Anthony Cole is a close combat specialist who also possesses a \{ref H_ui.seml#_cole_special_move_1} Shotgun special move.\{/ref} \\{br}
This allows him to attack enemies from medium range. The \{ref H_ui.seml#_cole_special_move_1} shot\{/ref} does percentual damage and is therefore well-suited for use against enemies with a lot of \{ref H_ui.seml#_iw_hitpoints}hit points.\{/ref}
Cole is a spontaneous, direct individual full of the joy of life who always says what he thinks and is prepared to defend his opinions. His lack of self-control sometimes gets him into trouble.\{p}

The son of an Italian-American mother and an Irish-American father, Anthony represents the joint product of two long lines of American immigrants. The Cole and Fratelli families belonged to lower middle-class New York.\{p}
Cole's father worked as a policeman until his suspension for repeatedly being drunk while on duty. The extensive contacts Cole's mother's family held soon brought the offer of a job in a security company in southern California. This led to the entire family moving to Los Angeles when Anthony was eleven. The next six years proved to be the happiest of his life.\{p}
In New York, street kids had to be able to use a knife to get ahead - in Los Angeles it was a surfboard. Together, the California sun, a joy in a wide variety of sports (at first baseball, skateboarding and swimming, and later surfing and free-climbing) and the miracles of pubescent human biology helped make Cole a very popular young man with just one small problem: the hot-blooded temperament he inherited from his mother.
It was this that led to his being involved in an almost never-ending series of fights. Since his mother always came to his defense ("My Tony would never do anything like that."). and his father was even proud of his sons' behavior ("That's my boy! He really knows how to take care of himself.") he never really learned to control his feelings.\{p}
Whenever he wasn't in school or a fight somewhere or playing sports Anthony loved to visit his father, who worked shifts at the "Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits" and the "Natural History Museum of Los Angeles." Cole was fascinated by the wonders of nature and began to develop a passion for fossils – a passion which would lead to his studying geology.\{p}
Cole was 17 when his father got fired from the security company. The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Foundation was not prepared to accept or forgive an unfortunate incident during which Mr. Cole Senior assaulted an Irish protestant visitor to the Page Museum without grounds using one of the pieces on exhibit (a prime example of just where a difference of opinion can lead on St. Patrick's Day).\{p}
Due to his age there was little or no chance of his finding another job, leaving the family with no other choice than to move to a small apartment in San Jose. Cole's mother managed to find a minimum-wage job in neighboring Silicon Valley typing long columns of numbers from old documents into a modern database. His father devoted more and more of his time to his high-proof hobby.\{p}
Cole – uprooted and lonely – became more and more a surly loner. His only refuge during this difficult period lay in his hobbies. He immersed himself even more deeply into his sports, an ancient Oldsmobile (Anthony has been a car enthusiast ever since he got his driver's license), which he loved to take for a spin whenever possible, and - school.\\{br}
To this point an average student, Cole studied with a hitherto unknown passion, having decided to under no circumstances end up like his father. He breezed into college, and later university.\{p}
Upon completing his Ph.D., Cole was offered a lucrative job on a Canadian oil platform, which he accepted enthusiastically. As much as geology fascinated him, he had little time for academic culture and most of his colleagues. He was proud of his immense salary and had no problem with the rough camaraderie on board. His only worries centered around two things he had to leave behind – his car (a Corvette convertible) and his fiancée.\{p}
His Corvette waited for him faithfully, which is more than can be said for his fiancée. His first holiday at home ended in disaster – having discovered the truth about his fiancée, Cole got thoroughly drunk and lost both his driver's license and his car.\{p}
Somewhat less than completely cooperative, Anthony was later charged with "Resisting arrest" – and lost his job. Frustrated and confused, he applied for a graduate stipendium at his Alma Mater and was accepted.\{p}
Cole completed his studies in geology with distinction and specialized in sediments. During his post-graduate project he discovered a spot on an Indian reserve on the Nevada border (in an area the Indians considered holy) where different rock strata appeared to have been "twirled," intertwining in a most peculiar manner.\{p}
At the last moment, the \{ref H_story.seml#_story_seas} SEAS\{/ref} managed to prevent Cole from being able to publish an excellent article on the subject. Cole became suspicious and secretly began to spend his time examining crop circles, the Bermuda Triangle, and other similar phenomena.

Except for during the tutorial and at the beginning of level 1, Stina Holmlund rides an \{ref H_animals.seml#_eusmilus}Eusmilus \{/ref} and attacks at short range.\\{br}
A special ability allows her to \{ref H_ui.seml#_stina_special_move_1} hypnotise animals\{/ref} and get them to lie motionless for a while, but she has to touch the animal in order to do so.
Stina is a self-confident, open woman who tends to use common sense and empathy in solving problems.\{p}

Stina was born on May 5th 1972 in Stockholm, the daughter of Danish diplomat Björn Holmlund and Swedish politician Anne Holmlund, born Andersson.\{p}
Her mother is a member of the Swedish Green Party and passed a strong love of the beauty of nature on to her daughter. She spent all her holidays with her grandfather Olav Andersson, who breeds and trains sled-dogs in Kiruna. Together they have taken many a trip through Sweden's lonely landscape, trips which often place harsh demands on both of them.\{p}
The effort and privations of such activity brought Stina to a level of fitness which proved useful time and again. Elementary and secondary school posed little problem. Her natural intelligence and the diligence instilled in her by her parents and grandfather made even difficult problems seem deceptively easy. She was less successful in dealing with the amorous advances of her fellow students.\{p}
Although she has had a number of short affairs she has never really felt fulfilled. Early in life Stina began to suspect that she outstripped most of her male counterparts. She found the sons of other diplomats particularily annoying with their superficiality and arrogant behavior. She despised the shallow party girls she grew up with and longed instead for more meaningful conversation.\{p}
Stina began studying biology and veterinary medicine at Sweden's oldest university in Uppsala in 1992. She continued to work for her grandfather during semester breaks. She completed both courses of study with honours in 1998 after just 10 semesters. In 1999 she gained her doctorate in veterinary medicine.\{p}
Her doctoral thesis deals with anachronistic animals which have changed but little over thousands of years, seemingly in defiance of evolution. During the course of her first project, Stina fell in love with one of her colleagues, a young professor who was unfortunately married. Even though this was the first relationship that ever gave Stina what she was looking for - namely a man who takes her seriously and is able to converse with her on equal terms - she ended it after less than a year. Stina is unwilling to play second fiddle in a relationship.\{p}
Still, the two managed to part as friends. Stina left the project and began her second doctoral thesis, this time in biology. She did her research on a special type of unicellular organism which, according to evolutionary theory, should long since have died out.\{p}
Stina remained an active animal protectionist throughout her studies.

Béla Benedek is an excellent archer.\\{br}
His range increases with each level; when chief, his range is greater than that of any other infantry \{ref H_general.seml#_units} unit.\{/ref}\{p}

His father was a doctor, his mother a nurse. The youngest of two children, Béla is 4 years younger than his sister, who works as a teacher in Sopron.\\{br}
He had an easy time of it in school. His father was convinced that since, as the son of a doctor, Béla would never be allowed to go to university anyway (equality of opportunity under communism) there was no reason to force him. His extremely good grades were solely the result of his own natural abilities.\{p}
At the age of 14 he took part in 1989's Pan-European Picknick. The successful crossing of the border defenses by a number of East Germans made a lasting impression on him (the famous Hungarian Escape).\{p}
The political changes which took place in Eastern Europe also opened new opportunities for young Béla, and he decided to attend high school, from which he graduated in June of 1993. He then registered at the local university, where he studied physics.\\{br}
One of his professors, Prof. László Tamás, recognized his unusual abilities and the two formed a deep friendship which lasts to this day. Tamás encouraged Béla to participate in a student exchange program in order to further his studies. In 1995 Béla went to the prestigious Lomonosov University in Moskow (Alma Mater to almost all Russian Nobel Prize winning physicists) for two years of study.\\{br}
In 1998 he finished his degree with a major in theoretical physics. He began to write his doctoral thesis in Russia, where he shared a research project with colleagues from the USA and China. In 1999 Béla accepted an offer to go to MIT. There he joined a fraternity which he soon left, disturbed by its strange rituals and customs. He submitted his doctoral thesis on "Conditional Anomalies of Sub-Atomic Particles in Multi-Dimensional Spaces" in 2001 and successfully defended it the same year.\{p}
Béla is allergic to onions, which give him an unbearable itch and result in a terrible rash. However, it was exactly this extremely uncomfortable condition which led the armed forces to declaring him unfit for military service. His allergy makes him a very fussy eater and he seldom eats in restaurants. He knits to relax, for he finds the precise movements extremely soothing.

Receiving his schooling in a nearby city, Taslow excelled at his studies, finally studying electrical engineering at an Austrian university. Upon completing his studies with honours he moved to Budapest, where he went to work for an American company.\\{br}
It was this company which would lead to his leaving his war-torn country for the United States.\\{br}
It didn't take long for young Taslow to make a name for himself as a brilliant theorist and engineer, and he worked with such greats as Edison and Westinghouse before going into business for himself.\\{br}
His pioneer research into electricity and radio resulted in a number of important patents and international recognition before his disappearance under mysterious circumstances.

James Warden was a brilliant naturalist and biologist with an uncanny ability to \{ref H_ui.seml#_warden_special_move_1}tame wild animals. \{/ref}\{p}

Born at the start of the nineteenth century, James Warden was an English naturalist who developed the basis of what is now the modern theory of evolution by proposing natural selection as a mechanism.\\{br}
A worldwide sea voyage with many stops provided him with inspiration and a great deal of the data on which he based his theory.\{p}
James Warden was born the youngest of three children in a small town in England. His mother died when he was twelve, and the next year he entered boarding school. After finishing school Warden was sent to Edinburgh University to study medicine.\\{br}
At Edinburgh he soon grew disenchanted with the brutal surgical procedures of the time and began to neglect his studies, preferring to spend his time in student societies for naturalists. It was here that he met some of the period's most renowned naturalists and began his studies into change through acquired characteristics.\\{br}
Upon hearing of his work, James' father decided to separate him from his "ne'er-do-well" friends and enrolled him at Christ's College, Cambridge instead.\\{br}
At Cambridge James excelled in riding and shooting, much to the detriment of his studies. It was during this period that Warden met one of England's foremost naturalists, who later recommended him to the captain of the ship which would take him on his epic journey.\\{br}
It was this journey which honed his keen observational skills and his uncanny abilities in dealing with wild animals.\{p}
Upon his return he presented his findings and theories in a book which was to become a standard in natural science. While on a tour to promote his new book James Warden disappeared in an apparent shipwreck.\\{br}
His body was never found.

Jarvis Babbit is a cold, yet brilliant scientist with morals and ethics more suited to Victorian England than today's world.\{p}

Jarvis Babbit was an English mathematician, analytical philosopher, and scientist who would seem to have been the first person to come up with the idea of a programmable computer.\\{br}
Born in London in the late 18th century, he graduated from Cambridge in 1805. A few years later Babbit helped found the Analytical Society and later won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society "for his invention of an engine for calculating mathematical and astronomical tables".\\{br}
For many years he worked as a professor of mathematics at Cambridge. He contributed largely to several scientific periodicals, and was instrumental in founding both the Astronomical Society and the Statistical Society. During the later years of his life he resided in London, devoting himself to the construction of machines capable of performing arithmetical and even algebraic calculations.\\{br}
It was during this time that Jarvis Babbit gradually became ever more reclusive, drawing back from public life. His research turned to the esoteric, many said, and he eventually founded the \{ref H_story.seml#_story_seas}SEAS, the Society for the Exact Alternative Sciences. \{/ref}\\{br}
His few friends were heard to remark that his lifestyle must have been most healthy indeed, as he hardly seemed to age at all. Little is known of his later years, although he is thought to have died in 1871.

Leighton was born in Glasgow, Scotland in the early 1800's and studied medicine and theology at the University of Glasgow.\\{br}
He later joined the London Missionary Society, becoming a minister.\\{br}
Sent to Africa in the mid 1800's he had little success, making few conversions to the christian faith. It was perhaps his failure in this respect which contributed to his growing fanaticism.\{p}
After a short return visit to England he turned to exploration. Leighton was one of the first Westerners to complete a transcontinental journey across Africa.
The purpose of his journey was to open trade routes, whilst accumulating useful information about the African continent. Leighton was a fierce proponent of trade and missions to be established in central Africa, all of which ended in disaster.\\{br}
Leighton returned to Africa years later as head of a large expedition. While Leighton was exploring a large African river he contracted a strange illness and eventually failed to reappear from an exploratory hike.\\{br}

Heinrich Kleemann was a distinguished German archaeologist and expert on ancient civilisations.\{p}

Born into a poor German family in 1815, Kleemann attended school but was unable to complete his studies for financial reasons.\\{br}
After a number of years in minor clerical positions Kleemann discovered his talent for trade and by his mid-thirties he was a millionare.\\{br}
It was then that Kleemann began to indulge his passion for archaeology, a passion he said his father imbued in him.\\{br}
Kleemann's greatest assets in his career as a classical archaeologist were his tenacity and organisational skills, which helped him make finds which had eluded other archaeologists for decades.
Unfortunately he also evinced other personality traits which were less desirable. Branded a cheat, braggart and liar, he was eventually proven to have faked a number of his most spectacular finds and was convicted of smuggling antiquities out of the Middle East.\\{br}
Long hailed as the expert on ancient civilisations Kleemann was quick to notice his incipient decline and suddenly began to fall ill. It is rumoured that his apparent death from an infection was in fact feigned, and that he disappeared with the help of some unknown accomplices.
