"_db_4207_Frame_3";"So?"
"_db_4207_Frame_4";"We should try to find the missing team. They were carrying expensive equipment. We might need it later."
"_db_4209_Frame_0";"What kind of sick games are we into, Kleemann?"

"_db_4218_Frame_1";"Don't be ridiculous, Kleemann. Undead? Don't you think this is a little far-fetched!?"

"_db_4219_Frame_0";"Be careful! There are a lot of traps in this area."

"_db_4228_Frame_0";"It's starting to get uncomfortable, more are coming!"
"_db_4228_Frame_1";"There are too many of them! Concentrate your attacks on the avatar, otherwise we won't make it !"

"_db_4309_Frame_0";"We have spotted the norsemen's port area, It seems to be separate from their main base."
