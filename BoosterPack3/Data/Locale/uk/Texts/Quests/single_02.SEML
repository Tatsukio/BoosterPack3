 \{p} \{p}
Hints:

2) In order to save the mammoths, all poachers must be driven out of the area around the caves and their buildings must be destroyed.
 \{p}
3) To get to the Mammoth Caves, follow the path North.

4) The display underneath the Resource Bar tells you \{br} how many mammoths you have saved already, and how many can be saved in total. For instance: If you’ve saved 3 out of 10 living mammoths, the display would say 3/10.

	\{section -name L02MQ03_destroy_the_poachers}
Find and destroy all Dustriders on this island! You need to defeat them all to secure the mammoths’ future. The Dustrider Base is situated in the Northern part of the island. You can use your new Battle Mammoths against \{br}the poachers. In addition, you should protect your base with a wall.

\{p} \{p}
Hints:
\{p}
1) You can now produce mammoths in the Large Animal Farm.
 \{p}
2) You should place a small advance base behind one of the mammoth caves to shorten the way from their home base. In addition, there are stone and wood resources close to the mammoth caves.

	\{section -name L02SQ01_establish_a_base}
First, expand your base before you venture forth on the island and catch the poachers. Invent Epoch 3 and\{br}build a weapon smith, a temple, a barracks and a large animal farm (the upgrade of the small animal farm). Use\{br} the weapon smith to produce another 5 Lancers.

\{p} \{p}
Hints:
\{p}
1) Some buildings or updates are only available after you have invented a new Epoch.
 \{p}
2) You need to have 5 lancers available at the same time, i.e. it’s not sufficient to produce 5 lancers if one or more of them get killed in the course of the game.
 \{p}
3) The poachers are aggressive and can attack out of the blue; build enough units to defeat them early on in the game.
