1) All Heroes must survive!
\{p} \{p}
Hints:

 \{p}
2) You cannot control, heal, or promote Taslow directly.

Babbit has started the Scorpio and attacks you with it! Eliminate this mechanical monster!
\{p} \{p}
Objectives:
\{p}
1) Attack the Scorpio! You need to tackle the control station as soon as Taslow has opened it.
 \{p}
\{p} \{p}
Hints:
\{p}
1) The Scorpio can attack you with its legs, claws, and even his flamethrower. If you cause enough damage to the Scorpio, these functions will continually diminish.
 \{p}
2) The Scorpio is a very strong unit which can cause massive damage! Don’t stand around, try and avoid its fierce attacks! There are no safe spots on the battlefield, you need to keep moving!
	\{/section}

	\{section -name L16MQ04}
Babbit must give up the destroyed Scorpio, but he still has his mechanized combat suit.
\{p} \{p}
Objectives:
\{p}
1) Destroy Babbit!
\{p} \{p}
Hints:
\{p}
1) Babbit will try to kill his archrival Taslow. You need to stop him!

	\{/section}

	\{section -name L16SQ01}
The towers located close to the bases are directed from control centers which can easily be reprogrammed. \{br}If you destroy all SEAS troops in the vicinity of a control building and then approach it with two heroes you can then reprogram the towers to fire on your enemies.
\{p} \{p}
Objectives:

\{p}
1) Find the two control buildings for the towers, \{br}eliminate the SEAS troops in the vicinity, and move at \{br}least two heroes to the question mark near the control building!
\{p} \{p}
Hints:
\{p}
1) The SEAS cannot recapture the control buildings quickly enough, so you don’t need to worry about the towers.
 \{p}
2) The towers will help you cope with SEAS troops as they come under fire on their way to the combat scene. They are, however, useless when it comes to Babbit’s monstrous Scorpio as it is outside their reach.
