"_seq_1000_stina_01";"Your society the SEAS, the Exact…" 
"_seq_1000_babbit_02";"Yes, I know, Society for the Exact Alternative Sciences…" 
"_seq_1000_stina_02";"Exactly, your society is reputed to be somewhat generous in funding novel scientific research into the\nworld as we know it. And we need that kind of support right now." 
"_seq_1000_babbit_03";"Well, so what do you know about… the world?" 
"_seq_1000_stina_03";"Now, I know this sounds crazy. I found some scales… \n According to the DNA analysis they are from a triceratops. \n Yet my samples were less than 70 years old." 
"_seq_1000_cole_01";"As I mentioned, I'm a geologist, and, well, I'm here because while doing some stratographic fieldwork I\ndiscovered rock layers from three different geological ages.  The strata were woven together like…\nthe ponytail on that shrunken head over there." 
"_seq_1000_bela_01";"And if I may say so, Sir, during my latest research into astro-mechanics, I've correlated data showing immense\nirregularities within the gravitational fields. This can only point to one conclusion.\nThere is a second world out there." 
"_seq_1000_bela_02";"To be perfectly honest, sir, you are our last hope.\nIf we are to continue our work we shall need your support." 
"_seq_1000_babbit_04";"Well, we could show you a few things you might find quite instructive.\nAda, would you have time to take our esteemed colleagues on a tour?!" 
"_seq_1000_ada_01";"Why of course. I'd be delighted. Please, come with me." 
"_seq_1000a_ada_01";"Welcome aboard. Miss Holmlund, Mr. Benedek, Mr. Cole." 
"_seq_1000a_cole_01";"The pleasure is all mine, Miss…" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_02";"Oh, please, call me Ada.  All of you. We're all going to have such an incredible time together." 
"_seq_1000a_bela_01";"On the subject of time, Miss Ada. Precisely where and on what will we be spending all this time?" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_03";"First of all, we're taking you to a training facility where you can prepare for the expedition" 
"_seq_1000a_stina_01";"Can we finally have some more details on this expedition?" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_04";"That's something I'd rather not reveal as yet. But I can tell you this much: we'll be reaching our target\narea in about 6 hours. There our jump-box will be released and shortly thereafter we will arrive\nat the actual training camp." 
"_seq_1000a_bela_03";"Excuse me, please, what exactly is a jump-box?" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_05";"That object over there." 
"_seq_1000a_bela_04";"You mean the crate?" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_06";"If that's what you want to call it." 
"_seq_1000a_stina_02";"I don't like this. I'm not really into being thrown out of airplanes in a wooden packing crate." 
"_seq_1000a_cole_02";"'Sup Stina? Haven't you got any sense of adventure?" 
"_seq_1000a_stina_03";"If I wasn't before, now I'm here for strictly professional reasons." 
"_seq_1000a_bela_05";"And what do we need a 'jump box' for? Not, I presume, for the purpose of…\nobserving dangerous species or the like?" 
"_seq_1000a_ada_08";"Oh, it's just a way to get us down to the ground without using separate parachutes, that's all." 
"_seq_1000a_stina_04";"Somehow I still don't relish the idea of jumping out of the plane in that box." 
"_seq_1000a_cole_03";"Yo, baby, I'll hit the crate with you anytime." 
"_seq_1000a_stina_05";"No, no, Cole. Remember - the brain is for thinking – the brain." 
"_seq_1000a_ada_09";"Touché, Stina. I don't know what he's got on his mind, but then again – is his mind really the interesting part?" 
"_seq_1000a_stina_06";"I guess it's whatever turns you on." 
"_seq_1000a_ada_10";"Everybody hold on tight! We're ready to roll." 
"_seq_1000a_ada_11";"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Viking Park." 
"_seq_1000a_cole_04";"Cool! Now THATS making an entrance!" 
"_seq_0101_ada_01";"I'm sure you're exhausted from your travels. Why don't you rest up a bit and then explore your surroundings." 
"_seq_0103_nordvolk_01";"We're under attack! To arms!" 
"_seq_0103_ada_01";"I'm afraid your rest will have to wait a bit. Come on!" 
"_seq_0107_bela_01";"I've never seen a cat that big in all my life." 
"_seq_0107_ada_01";"They're attacking the workers! Do something!" 
"_seq_0111_stina_01";"I want a closer look at that cadaver." 
"_seq_0111_ada_01";"First we should check and see just how much damage the attack caused." 
"_seq_0111_stina_02";"Okay, then, we'll join you." 
"_seq_0201_ada_01";"The main building was only lightly damaged. We should be able to repair it ourselves." 
"_seq_0201_cole_01";"Guess I'll go get the tools." 
"_seq_0201_ada_02";"We have people for that. The necessary resources can be found in the immediate area.\nIt'd be best if you could keep an eye on the workers." 
"_seq_0204_cole_01";"Why is that taking so long?" 
"_seq_0204_bela_01";"Efficiency is equal to the number of workers times their productivity." 
"_seq_0204_cole_02";"So we need more workers? Why didn't you say that in the first place?" 
"_seq_0207_bela_01";"Our stone supplies are sinking much too quickly. We require more resources." 
"_seq_0207_stina_01";"We should split up and look fore more resources." 
"_seq_0209_bela_01";"So there are a few stones left here." 
"_seq_0209_stina_01";"I'll send over a couple of workers." 
"_seq_0212_ada_01";"Excellent! We now have enough resources to repair all the damaged buildings." 
"_seq_0212_cole_01";"Then I'll look after the practical end of things." 
"_seq_0215_bela_01";"Where did that monster come from?" 
"_seq_0215_stina_01";"Careful, it's going to attack." 
"_seq_0301_cole_01";"Man, I'm all in." 
"_seq_0301_bela_01";"I never new science could be so physically challenging." 
"_seq_0301_ada_01";"Unfortunately your training is not yet complete. You should delegate more of the work.\n Get yourself some more people to help you." 
"_seq_0313_bela_01";"No matter how many of these cats we kill, more just keep coming." 
"_seq_0313_stina_01";"There must be a den close by where they raise their young." 
"_seq_0313_cole_01";"Come on, let's take it out." 
"_seq_0317_stina_01";"The tracks lead directly towards that little hill." 
"_seq_0317_cole_01";"Keep those weapons handy, people." 
"_seq_0323_cole_01";"So, all that's left to do is hang the trophies over the fireplace." 
"_seq_0323_ada_01";"Congratulations. That calls for a celebration. Which of you is best at skinning and cleaning?" 
"_seq_0401_stina_01";"Why don't we use these animals ourselves?" 
"_seq_0401_cole_01";"You want to breed lap tigers? Isn't that a little on the dangerous side?" 
"_seq_0401_ada_01";"I thought you loved danger. I think Stina's idea is splendid." 
"_seq_0409_norsemen_01";"Thief! Stop that thief!" 
"_seq_0409_cole_01";"He's mine." 
"_seq_0409_ada_01";"You'll never catch him on foot. Take the chariot instead." 
"_seq_0410_cole_01";"He's gone. Just disappeared." 
"_seq_0410_stina_01";"Well, I'm sure he'll come again. We'll get him then." 
"_seq_0410_bela_01";"Only if we're faster than we were today." 
"_seq_0412_ada_01";"It seems we've found our thief. A scout reports having seen the missing items on a neighboring island." 
"_seq_0412_cole_01";"Time to get them back – and to have a little talk with the bad guys." 
"_seq_0412_stina_01";"We should take our troops with us. Who knows what might await us on that island." 
"_seq_0416_cole_01";"Looks like our little thief wasn't going solo." 
"_seq_0416_bela_01";"Looks a right little Hannibal, doesn't he?" 
"_seq_0416_ada_01";"Now we'll see just how well-prepared we really are." 
"_seq_0417_ada_01";"Congratulations! You've completed all your assignments." 
"_seq_0417_cole_01";"Then we can finally get started?" 
"_seq_0417_ada_02";"Naturally. But first, I have a few preparations to complete. \nRest a bit in the meanwhile – you've really earned it." 
"_seq_1010_leighton_01";"Good evening, Ada!  At the appointed time, the Lord shall return." 
"_seq_1010_ada_01";"David, what are you doing here?" 
"_seq_1010_leighton_02";"Ada, the new recruits will be arriving tomorrow. Those three must be gone before they arrive.\nI don't care how you do it, just as long as it gets done." 
"_seq_1010_leighton_03";"Don't fail us." 
"_seq_1010_ada_02";"Anthony, wake up!" 
"_seq_1010_cole_01";"Wha- Ada? Nmmh… I thought you'd never ask!" 
"_seq_1010_ada_03";"We have to get out of here." 
"_seq_1010_cole_02";"I don't know, baby, this is all happening so fast…" 
"_seq_1010_ada_04";"No time for romance. I'll explain later. We have to go. You wake Stina and Béla and\nwe'll meet down by the water." 
"_seq_1010_cole_03";"" 
"_seq_1010_stina_01";"Could someone please tell me what is so important that we have to risk our lives for it?" 
"_seq_1010_ada_05";"Look out!" 
"_seq_1020_cole_01";"What the?! What the hell kinda animal is that?" 
"_seq_1020_norsemen_01";"Fight now, talk later. Please!" 
"_seq_1021_cole_01";"Man, that was tight… Where the hell did HE pop up from?" 
"_seq_1021_norsemen_01";"You must destroy the nest before more of them come." 
"_seq_1023_norsemen_01";"That was very brave – thank you for your help." 
"_seq_1023_cole_01";"Ain't no thing, bro. What kinda monster was that, anyways?" 
"_seq_1023_norsemen_02";"Later. My village is under attack. I must go." 
"_seq_1023_cole_02";"Yo. Look, I'll give you a hand. Maybe then I'll be able to get a few answers." 
"_seq_1026_norsemen_chief_01";"Close the gates! Stop them! Let no-one escape!" 
"_seq_1026_cole_01";"Man, doesn't the fighting ever end around here?" 
"_seq_1028_cole_01";"So, that's the last of them. Now can I ask you a few questions, or what?" 
"_seq_1028_norsemen_chief_01";"I'll answer all of your questions as soon as we find my son. \n He was forced down towards the beach during the fighting." 
"_seq_1028_cole_02";"Naturally. Okay, okay. Fine. I'll go look for him." 
"_seq_1030_norsemen_chief_01";"You fought well. I thank you for your help, warrior." 
"_seq_1030_cole_01";"My pleasure, bro. Just one thing, though: \n my peeps have kinda disappeared, y'know, and I gotta find 'em." 
"_seq_1030_norsemen_chief_02";"Then you should follow those who attacked us. Time and again they kidnap my warriors. Perhaps they are holding your companions captive as well." 
"_seq_1030_cole_02";"Agreed. I shall go forth and free your brothers and sisters – and hopefully find my friends." 
"_seq_1029_cole_01";"Yo. There're the dudes that kidnapped your friends." 
"_seq_1029_norsemen_01";"If we attack from here they will see us right away." 
"_seq_1029_cole_02";"Then I guess we better find a way to hit 'em from behind." 
"_seq_1031_cole_01";"Yo, baby. This thing might just prove to be very useful." 
"_seq_1032_norsemen_01";"By all the Gods, I can feel the power coursing through me." 
"_seq_1032_cole_01";"Looks like that thing has truly got the power…" 
"_seq_1033_cole_01";"It's a trap." 
"_seq_1033_bloodnorsemen_01";"They attack. Kill them all. And the prisoners." 
"_seq_1034_cole_01";"Hey, this is the perfect spot. They'll never expect an attack from this side." 
"_seq_1035_spearman_01";"Help us, please! Get the Barbarians off us." 
"_seq_1037_spearman_01";"You saved our lives. We are in your debt." 
"_seq_1037_cole_01";"Well, that's a word, bro, 'cause I could really use some help taking down the Barbarians, know what I mean?" 
"_seq_1040_cole_01";"Stina? You okay?" 
"_seq_1040_stina_01";"Not really. There's a sweet little Eusmilus down here –\nand a whole big pack of nasty, hungry Smilodons." 
"_seq_1050_cole_01";"I'm impressed, girl. You sure did kick some butt on them cats." 
"_seq_1050_stina_01";"You just have to know their weak spots." 
"_seq_1050_cole_02";"So what's up with this li'l dude here?" 
"_seq_1050_stina_02";"Now that's my weak spot. He's staying with me." 
"_seq_1039_cole_01";"Yo. Isn't that another load of those Smilodons?" 
"_seq_1039_stina_01";"Sure is. I'll just stop them before they can do any more damage." 
"_seq_1039_cole_02";"Need any help?" 
"_seq_1039_stina_02";"The spearmen should be enough." 
"_seq_1039_cole_03";"Don't forget the nest." 
"_seq_1041_stina_01";"Well, the animal population should be able to recover now." 
"_seq_1041_cole_01";"Good. Then all we gotta do now is find Béla." 
"_seq_1060_bela_01";"Where is the North Star? Where is the bloody North Star? Either there isn't one here,\nor there are two of them. Where the bloody hell am I?" 
"_seq_1060_cole_01a";"Ladies first." 
"_seq_1060_pencil_head";"Keep your hands to yourself, pencilhead!" 
"_seq_1060_cole_01b";"" 
"_seq_1060_cole_01c";"Can you see anything?" 
"_seq_1060_stina_01";"Some cages full of captive Norsemen… And Béla." 
"_seq_1060_cole_02";"Then let's bust him out!" 
"_seq_1060_bela_02";"Now is my chance." 
"_seq_1060_bela_03";"Come on, come on… Yes…" 
"_seq_1042_archer_01";"Thank you for freeing us. What should we do now?" 
"_seq_1042_bela_01";"Together we shall teach these barbarians a lesson they'll never bloody forget. Ready your bows." 
"_seq_1043_blood_norsemen_01";"The prisoners have escaped. Kill them!" 
"_seq_1044_blood_norsemen_01";"We're under attack! To arms! To arms!" 
"_seq_1045_blood_norsemen_01";"Those are prisoners - and they're armed." 
"_seq_1046_blood_norsemen_01";"An attack? How did they get in here?" 
"_seq_1047_bela_01";"It would seem that we now have this camp firmly in hand." 
"_seq_1048_bela_01";"You're safe for now. Wait here until we've taken out all of the Barbarians." 
"_seq_1049_bela_01";"No, no. Not yet. Wait here. It's still much too dangerous for all of you." 
"_seq_1051_bela_01";"Very well, it's time. You may come out now, everything is under control." 
"_seq_1070_stina_01";"Who are those guys?" 
"_seq_1070_bela_01";"They found me on the beach. At first I thought it was just part of the training. But then… during the night they came and dragged a couple of the prisoners out of their cages and… ate them." 
"_seq_1071_bela_01";"We made it. We actually made it!" 
"_seq_1071_stina_01";"Luckily, yes. At least we're all back together again." 
"_seq_1071_cole_01";"Before we do anything else we should scout the rest of the island." 
"_seq_1071_norsemen_01";"Watch out for the barbarians! This is a large tribe, and you only defeated a few of them up to now!" 
"_seq_1071_bela_02";"Then I guess we had best be careful." 
"_seq_1053_cole_01";"Well, that's a start." 
"_seq_1054_cole_01";"Now that's what I call takin' care of business. Guess it's time to get us some troops." 
"_seq_1055_cole _01";"And now it's time to kick a little Barbarian booty." 
"_seq_1057_cole_01";"Now that's what I call kickin' some butt!" 
"_seq_1057_bela_01";"Yes, of course. But with so little resistance I suspect that this was only a small outpost." 
"_seq_1059_cole_01";"Man, this place would be perfect for a Halloween party." 
"_seq_1059_stina_01";"All that's missing are the candies and the little presents." 
"_seq_1059_bela_01";"I'm certain we can do something about that. Look! The crate over there!" 
"_seq_1056_stina_01";"You just want to drink." 
"_seq_1120_cole_01";"Now if we could only figure out where on earth we are…" 
"_seq_1120_bela_01";"We're not on planet earth. This is not our world."
"_seq_1120_stina_01";"Over the last few days I've learned to accept quite a few 'weird' things. Like, did any of you see a\nsingle flash of lightning during the storm? Huh? Well, you know, I asked the Norsemen\nand they don't even know what lightning is."  
"_seq_1120_bela_02";"I've spent my whole life gazing at the stars. But I've never seen those constellations before." 
"_seq_1120_stina_02";"Okay guys, What exactly can we conclude about this world?" 
"_seq_1120_bela_03";"Other than the fact that the prehistoric animals have not died out here…" 
"_seq_1120_stina_03";"I wouldn't call them prehistoric – not anymore." 
"_seq_1120_cole_02";"What are you two driving at?" 
"_seq_1120_stina_04";"Maybe the dinosaurs never existed in 'earlier' times, you know. Maybe they live here, simple as that." 
"_seq_1120_bela_04";"And the skeletal remains…" 
"_seq_1120_bela_05";"So, the question would seem to be just how did we get here?" 
"_seq_1120_stina_05";"… are from animals that somehow managed to make it into our world." 
"_seq_1120_cole_02a";"And just how do you think that happened?" 
"_seq_1120_stina_06";"The exact same way that WE got here." 
"_seq_1120_cole_03";"Man, that all sounds a little weird, you know." 
"_seq_1120_LOYALHU_01";"There is a wise druid, the guardian of our legends, who lives on an island not far from here. If anyone can help you, then it is he. You should go see him."
"_seq_1120_stina_07";"How do you figure that?" 
"_seq_1120_cole_04";" " 
"_seq_1120_norseman_01";" "
"_seq_1090_stina_01";"That must be it up there." 
"_seq_1090_bela_01";"Then let's be off." 
"_seq_1090_druid_01";"You have traveled between the parallel lines." 
"_seq_1090_druid_02";"You now wish to leave this world and return to your own."
"_seq_1090_stina_02";"And that's exactly why we're here: To ask for your help."
"_seq_1090_druid_03";"Yes, I could help you. But I do not have the time.\nFor it is my task to protect the Sacred Forest in the north of the island…"
"_seq_1090_stina_03";"Seems to me the forest is doing fine all by itself."
"_seq_1090_druid_04";"And so it was. Yet now a tribe of Dustriders has come to the island. They care nothing about the world in\nwhich they live. They hunt the holy mammoths and destroy the balance of nature."
"_seq_1090_bela_02";"And what if we were to help you by driving off the Dustriders?"
"_seq_1090_druid_05";"Then I would be honor-bound to do all within my vast powers to help you."
"_seq_1082_druid_01";"I am in your debt. You have saved the holy mammoths from a truly terrible fate.\nIn turn I shall teach you how to use their fighting strength to your own ends."
"_seq_1083_druid_01";"You failed. Too many of the mammoths died. Now go, and leave me with my pain."
"_seq_1084_druid_01";"You have done well indeed. My confidence grows like the plants after a sommer rain. Let us seek the other mammoths."
"_seq_1091_druid_01";"You have found a piece of sacred jewelry. A very good omen. It will henceforth bring us luck."
"_seq_1092_bela_01";"It would seem this wreck has more to offer than we originally thought. We should keep it. The pirates certainly no longer have need of it."
"_seq_1093_druid_01";"I see the village has firmly taken root and grows strong and true as an oak. Now it is time for you to look after the mammoths. Four mammoth families live upon my island. I fear the Dustriders intend to slay them all."
"_seq_1093_bela_01";"Perhaps we should build a protective wall around the area before we leave."
"_seq_1094_bela_01";"We must proceed carefully. First we should concentrate on erecting a fort and training some pikemen. Then we can go hunting for the poachers."
"_seq_1095_druid_01";"This island has offered many refuge throughout the years, and some of their treasures remain. Watchful eyes may still uncover these treasures in the forests and the fields."
"_seq_1096_druid_01";"The world itself has brought you to me! I will help you. In the north of the island, between two snow-covered mountains, you will find a smilodon, powerful and dangerous. Bring me one of his teeth and I shall fashion you a powerful talisman."
"_seq_1097_druid_01";"Excellent. The stars are in your favor and the winds of fortune sing in the trees. I shall prepare your gift."
"_seq_1099_druid_01";"The mammoths are dying, this I feel."
"_seq_2001_druid_01";"Four mammoth families live upon my island. I fear the Dustriders intend to slay them all. The poachers are powerful. I don't think your brothers-in-arms can match their numbers and power."
"_seq_2002_cole_01";"Yo. That should keep the place safe for awhile."
"_seq_1100_druid_01";"I can feel peace returning to the sacred grove."
"_seq_1100_stina_01";"We are honored that we have been able to help."
"_seq_1100_druid_02";"I have questioned the Oracle: your path leads south. There you will encounter a man –\na man with a key to open the gate to your world."
"_seq_2005_stina_01";""
"_seq_2005_cole_01";"Oh yeah."
"_seq_2005_trader_01";"Aaaahhh, at last. You are surely someone who recognizes a sensational offer. May I present myself: Larry,\nPresident of the Worldwide Corporation of Independent Traders."
"_seq_2005_bela_01";"President?"
"_seq_2005_trader_02";"Elected almost unanimously."
"_seq_2005_stina_02";"Just about?"
"_seq_2005_trader_03";"My brother Harry was against it. But my brother Barry and I outvoted him."
"_seq_2005_trader_04";"Yes I certainly did. And it's not available in stores. \nMy brother Barry, has been captured by a bunch of amazons and I want you guys to go and free him."
"_seq_2005_stina_03a";"And you have a great offer, now?"
"_seq_2005_stina_03";"Seems like a one-sided deal to me."
"_seq_2005_trader_05";"As chance would have it, I happen to have a good supply of stone on board which I could let you have.\nAnd if you decide right away I'll toss in a flight in my zeppelin, free of charge."
"_seq_2005_bela_02";"It's a deal. Do you take credit cards?"
"_seq_2005_trader_06";"Here."
"_seq_2006_flying_trader_01";"Ok my friends, I'm going to cruise around a bit. Maybe then I'll be able to give you a couple of tips. Free of charge, naturally."
"_seq_2007_flying_trader_01";"What luck. I see an uninhabited islands that's just loaded with wood."
"_seq_2008_flying_trader_01";"That looks like one of our family heirlooms down there. My brother must have lost it."
"_seq_2008_stina_01";"Or he left a trail for us to follow."
"_seq_2008_flying_trader_02";"Of course! He had two other pieces of jewelry with him. I'll keep my eyes peeled."
"_seq_2011_flying_trader_01";"Ahhh. You've finally built a second marketplace. As long as no-one takes you for a ride while trading you should be okay for resources."
"_seq_2012_flying_trader_01";"Here's another piece of that jewelry. Looks like that's the easiest way to the temple. Not bad, brother mine!"
"_seq_2013_flying_trader_01";"Here! Another heirloom! Hmm, what a beach. The perfect place to relax."
"_seq_2013_stina_01";"More like a perfect landing spot for our ships."
"_seq_2014_cole_01";"Yo. Sweet fortress those Amazon babes have built."
"_seq_2014_bela_01";"I don't think we'll be able to just march through that impressive front door."
"_seq_2014_stina_01";"Then I guess we should look for the back door, ladies."
"_seq_2015_bela_01";"I'm not so sure it was such a good idea to force our way in through the the main door."
"_seq_2015_cole_01";"Look. Are we in, or not?"
"_seq_2016_bela_01";"Welcome to the lion's den."
"_seq_2016_stina_01";"Let's hope we can remain undiscovered. At least until we get enough troops here."
"_seq_2017_bela_01";"that was almost too easy. Now we just open the front door…"
"_seq_2017_cole_01";"…and it's time to party."
"_seq_2018_cole_01";"Man, it's quiet here. Where are we?"
"_seq_2018_bela_01";"It's called a back door. Obviously the weak point in their defences. However, if that's too simple for you…"
"_seq_2010_amazonen_koenigin_01";"Who dares challenge Tarna, Queen of the Amazons and Protector of holy Aschnabar?"
"_seq_2010_stina_01";"Stina, guardian of the microbes and the defender of penicillin! Release Barry."
"_seq_2010_tarna_01";"What gives you the right to slaughter my people and take away a male?"
"_seq_2010_stina_02";"This mighty army."
"_seq_2010_tarna_02";"Sigh. You shall have him!"
"_seq_2010_trader_barry_00";"Argh!"
"_seq_2010_trader_barry_01";"Finally! I was beginning to think no-one was going to show up."
"_seq_2010_cole_01";"Looks like some of those Dustriders want to join us."
"_seq_2010_stina_03";"Good, maybe they can help us with our search."
"_seq_2010_tarna_03";"What shall become of my sisters and I?"
"_seq_2010_stina_04";"Hm, I think that's taking care of itself."
"_seq_2010_haendler_larry_01";"Right. All aboard now!"
"_seq_2020_babbit_01";"Commence ignition."
"_seq_2020_seas_soldier_01";"Yes sir."
"_seq_2020_stina_01";"Those animals are panic-struck. We'll never be able to calm them down."
"_seq_2020_cole_01";"Then I guess we'll have to do it the hard way."
"_seq_2026_bela_01";"Larry, what are you doing here?"
"_seq_2026_trader_01";"I'm Harry. I got a little too close to a Barbarian village with my zeppelin, and they shot me down."
"_seq_2026_trader_02";"I was hoping you'd say that. I'm afraid the Barbarians will be here pretty soon to cart away the spoils. Just keep them off me long enough for me to fix my zeppelin."
"_seq_2027_trader_01";"Here you go. thanks for the help."
"_seq_2027_stina_01";"That's IT?"
"_seq_2027_flying_trader_01";"Would a map of all the Barbarian bases in the area help?"
"_seq_2027_bela_01";"Looks like we will be able to do business, after all."
"_seq_2030_stina_01";"We've found a group of Barbarians. They look like they're guarding something."
"_seq_2030_bela_01";"Barbarians? Here?"
"_seq_2030_dustrider_01";"It is a holy place. They drove us off. Now they are desecrating holy ground."
"_seq_2030_cole_01";"Sounds like our old buddies the Barbarians alright."
"_seq_2030_stina_02";"Then I guess it's time for their next lesson."
"_seq_2022_cole_01";"Yo, the dino problem is - under control."
"_seq_2022_bela_01";"They did do a lot of damage, though."
"_seq_2022_stina_01";"And they'll be back. They just made this their new hunting grounds."
"_seq_2022_bela_02";"We'll have to set up camp somewhere else."
"_seq_2022_stina_02";"We should be safe further to the west. A scout can look for a suitable location."
"_seq_2022_bela_03";"Good. Let's go get things ready to go."
"_seq_2023_stina_01";"We found the perfect place. A large plain to the west – we should be safe there for awhile."
"_seq_2023_bela_01";"Good. Let's get these tents down, then."
"_seq_2024_cole_01";"So. Moving day is officially over. The little shoesies are all color-sorted in their little closet."
"_seq_2024_stina_01";"This place is perfectly suited to our needs."
"_seq_2028_cole_01";"Oh, man, what's that funky smell? Baby, that's raw."
"_seq_2028_bela_01";"Those are animal carcasses! I've never seen so many in one place."
"_seq_2028_cole_02";"Maybe it's a kind of elephant's graveyard for dinosaurs."
"_seq_2028_stina_01";"No, these animals were poisoned."
"_seq_2028_bela_02";"Then let's find out who's responsible."
"_seq_2029_bela_01";"It looks like we've found the source of the problem."
"_seq_2029_stina_01";"I suspect that the volcanic eruption released something poisonous."
"_seq_2029_cole_01";"Unusual, but possible."
"_seq_2029_stina_02";"I'm taking a sample. Who knows what we might learn."
"_seq_2031_bela_01";"That must be the main Barbarian camp. Just look at them all."
"_seq_2031_stina_01";"If we can take this camp it will weaken them immensely."
"_seq_2031_cole_01";"Then we just won't take 'no' for an answer."
"_seq_2040_leighton_01";"Lieutenant – cover my retreat."
"_seq_2040_lieutenant_01";"Yes, Sir!"
"_seq_2045_cole_01";"C'mon you guys. Follow me!"
"_seq_2045_cole_02";"C'mon, you guys. Let's do this!"
"_seq_2045_aje_01";"When the Horn of the Gods so commands, the instruments of war must be silent."
"_seq_2045_cole_03";"What, you just gonna let those jerks go?"
"_seq_2045_aje_02";"There are laws which demand respect unless you want the fury of the Gods to strike you down.\nThe time for the assembly has come. The High Council is calling the people to consult together\nin harmony and peace."
"_seq_2045_stina_01";"The High Council – maybe they know how we can get off this world. I think we should go and find out what they know."
"_seq_2047_inhabitant_01";"I'm sorry, but this inn is closed. I can't afford to let the pirates break in again."
"_seq_2048_stina_01";"If we get separated we'll meet back here in the tavern."
"_seq_2051_inhabitant_01";"Those scoundrels! They've kidnapped my daughter. They rampage through the streets\ntaking whatever they want. Someone has to stop them."
"_seq_2052_inhabitant_01";"Please help us. I've asked the council for help time and again. We need help in fighting off these bandits."
"_seq_2053_inhabitant_01";"The pirates break into our homes and plunder and murder. Enough is enough! Now we're going to fight back!"
"_seq_2053_stina_01";"Maybe it's a better idea to leave the fighting to those who know what they're doing."
"_seq_2053_inhabitant_02";"Like who? Will YOU fight for us?"
"_seq_2055_stina_01";"Let us in. We request an audience with the High Council."
"_seq_2055_templeguard_01";"Impossible. The gates stay closed."
"_seq_2055_bela_01";"Might I ask why?"
"_seq_2055_templeguard_02";"Council orders. As long as the pirates are on the loose, none may enter."
"_seq_2055_cole_01";"Why hasn't anyone done anything about these pirates?"
"_seq_2055_templeguard_03";"Funny you should ask. Looking at you the same question just occured to me.\nIf you're in such a hurry to see the council maybe YOU should do something about the pirates."
"_seq_2056_templeguard_01";"The council's decision is clear: none may enter as long as the pirates are still in the city."
"_seq_2060_bela_01";"Isn't that Larry or one of his brothers over there?"
"_seq_2060_flying_trader_01";"Ah, you must be those helpful heroes my brother told me about. I'm Harry."
"_seq_2060_stina_01";"Since we're so helpful you probably have a little assignment for us, right?"
"_seq_2060_flying_trader_02";"Now that you mention it. Larry is waiting for my deliveries down at the harbor, but they seem to keep disappearing into thin air on the way."
"_seq_2060_cole_01";"Heavy. Is this our problem?"
"_seq_2060_flying_trader_03";"I understand. If you help me I'll fill your warehouses with food. Is that a deal?"
"_seq_2061_cole_01";"Yo. Scope this. Black pyjamas, masks and swords. Lemme guess - these gotta be the bad guys."
"_seq_2061_bela_01";"It's like something one would see in a cheap Kung-Fu movie."
"_seq_2061_stina_01";"As long as you ignore the fact that those are real swords and their owners are really bloodthirsty…"
"_seq_2062_flying_trader_01";"My friends, you did a great job. The roads are finally free for free traders."
"_seq_2062_stina_01";"I don't mean to be rude, but aren't we forgetting something…"
"_seq_2062_flying_trader_02";"What? Oh, yes – of course. I'll have the food delivered immediately."
"_seq_2063_bela_01";"One sip from this fountain and you feel like you've been reborn."
"_seq_2063_cole_01";"Then we'd better remember where they hide these little refreshment stands."
"_seq_2049_cole_01";"What was that?"
"_seq_2049_bela_01";"The pirates are escaping in their ship. They have hostages."
"_seq_2049_stina_01";"We can't let them reach the ship with those hostages."
"_seq_2054_city_guard_01";"Thank you for your heroic efforts. Finally someone is doing something about those guys."
"_seq_2054_stina_01";"Can we count on your help?"
"_seq_2054_stadtwache_01";"Of course. We'll fight to the last man."
"_seq_2058_city_guard_01";"Good idea clearing out this area first. Now we can let you have these war engines."
"_seq_2059_stina_01";"Are you and your animals okay?"
"_seq_2059_stallmeister_01";"You managed to get here before anything happened to us. May I offer my help in return?"
"_seq_2059_stina_02";"What kind of help?"
"_seq_2059_stallmeister_02";"The kind of help a huge, angry meat-eating dinosaur generally provides."
"_seq_2057_cole_01";"The pirates are escaping."
"_seq_2057_bela_01";"We're too late! They've taken the hostages with them."
"_seq_2057_stina_01";"We can't let them get away with this. We should follow them and put a stop to them once and for all."
"_seq_2090_leighton_01";"You failed to complete your mission."
"_seq_2090_ada_01";"Me! Me? - You dare accuse me of failure?! How dare you, you little worm!\n I've done more for this operation than anyone else, except for Jarvis.\n I recommended you for the job, David, remember, and you take your orders from me!"
"_seq_2090_babbit_01";"Not any longer, Ada."
"_seq_2090_ada_02";"What is that supposed to mean?"
"_seq_2090_babbit_02";"You are hereby suspended with immediate effect."
"_seq_2090_ada_03";"You're taking his side? I don't believe this!"
"_seq_2090_babbit_03";"Ada, it's just protective  custody till everything is resolved."
"_seq_2090_ada_04";"You intend to keep me prisoner?"
"_seq_2090_babbit_04";"I have no other choice."
"_seq_2090_ada_05";"Jarvis!"
"_seq_2090_babbit_05";"You were supposed to ensure that these three posed us no further danger, and now?\nNow we have them breathing down our throats!"
"_seq_2090_leighton_02";"This way, Ada… if you please!"
"_seq_8010_bela_01";"Damn, we're not getting anywhere here."
"_seq_8010_cole_01";"We gotta take out those towers."
"_seq_8010_bela_02";"That will be difficult from the water."
"_seq_8010_cole_02";"But doable."
"_seq_8010_stina_01";"What do you two think about finding an overland route instead?"
"_seq_8011_stina_01";"What's that floating in the water?"
"_seq_8011_bela_01";"It would appear to be a mine field."
"_seq_8011_cole_01";"We gotta find another way."
"_seq_8012_stina_01";"The overland route was worth it. From here we have a perfect field of fire on the pirates."
"_seq_8013_bela_01";"And the scourge of the seven seas slid to the bottom of the 0cean"
"_seq_8013_stina_01";"Hostage to the sea!"
"_seq_8013_cole_01";"The fishbait bonanza!"
"_seq_8014_prisoner_01";"I'd already given up all hope. Thanks for saving us."
"_seq_8016_cole_01";"Wassat?"
"_seq_8016_bela_01";"I'd say it's a fog machine. That could be useful. We should keep it in mind."
"_seq_8015_stina_01";"That looks like the perfect place for our base."
"_seq_8015_bela_01";"Hopefully we'll have enough time to finish up before the pirates find us."
"_seq_8020_pirate_01";"I want to negotiate."
"_seq_8020_bela_01";"Very well, then, we're listening."
"_seq_8020_pirate_02";"These slaves are worth a lot to us. But if you send us a load of goods we will release them."
"_seq_8020_bela_02";"Perhaps we can use this to our advantage. We could hide a spy in the wagon and thus find out just where the pirates are hiding."
"_seq_8018_cole_01";"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle."
"_seq_8018_stina_01";"What a big, hairy thing!"
"_seq_8018_bela_01";"I shouldn't get too close if I were you, Stina. He might be tempted to take you with him!"
"_seq_8030_bela_01";"We kept our part of the bargain, now it's your turn."
"_seq_8030_pirate_01";"There's just one small thing."
"_seq_8030_stina_01";"What's that supposed to mean? We had a deal!"
"_seq_8030_pirate_02";"Yes, but we were unaware that one of our prisoners is the Mistress of a Guild. That of course makes her highly valuable. My proposal is this: you send us another load of goods and then we'll let the prisoners go free."
"_seq_8030_cole_01";"I've got a proposal, too: you give us the prisoners and we won't ice you here and now."
"_seq_8030_pirate_03";"You'll take neither us nor the prisoners alive."
"_seq_8030_bela_02";"I think that's a strong basis for negotiations."
"_seq_8030_stina_02";"Me, too."
"_seq_8040_pirate_01";"I'll give you this: you guys are very reliable. Compared to us, anyways…"
"_seq_8040_cole_01";"What you sayin', now?"
"_seq_8040_pirate_02";"I'm afraid two wagon loads just aren't enough. I mean, there are more than two prisoners."
"_seq_8040_cole_02";"Can I kick his head in? Pretty please?"
"_seq_8040_bela_01";"Personally, I'm in favor of paying."
"_seq_8040_stina_01";"That might be a better idea."
"_seq_8042_pirate_01";"Nice of you to bring some more supplies, but we're not interested."
"_seq_8042_bela_01";"Which means?"
"_seq_8042_pirate_02";"The deal is off. And if you don't get out of here right now – well, you'll regret it."
"_seq_8042_cole_01";"Okay, I'm down for that. It's showtime."
"_seq_8045_pirate_01";"Oh, so you don't want to negotiate. Okay, then. Once we're done with you we'll grab the prisoners from the fortress and feed them to the fish."
"_seq_8080_bela_01";"Thank God all of the hostages are okay."
"_seq_8090_bela_02";"We've come here to consult with the High Council. We urgently need answers to our questions."
"_seq_8090_mayor_01";"What kind of questions do you have in mind?"
"_seq_8090_bela_03";"For instance: What is this world in which we now find ourselves?"
"_seq_8090_stina_01";"And what do you know about the mysterious gateways? You do know what I'm talking about?"
"_seq_8090_mayor_02";"Gateways? Certainly I know about  them. From old myths and legends. And of course from the prophecy."
"_seq_8090_stina_03";"Prophecy?"
"_seq_8090_mayor_03";"The heavens will darken, evil will destroy our world. Then heroes will descend from the heavens and deliver\nus from evil. Maybe YOU are those heroes the ancient writings mention. If that be so, then the doors of the\nforbidden library will open wide and you will attain wisdom that has been shrouded in darkness for aeons."
"_seq_8090_bela_04";"And what, may I ask would we have to do for that?"
"_seq_8090_mayor_04";"The first miracle the heroes will perform is for water to flow into the great desert once more. That's a…"
"_seq_8090_cole_01";"That's nuts."
"_seq_8090_mayor_05";"No, that's the prophecy! And it is not enough that you merely convince me you are the heroes,\nyou must also convince the council."
"_seq_2558_bela_01";"Perfect. Pirates behind us and desert in front of us."
"_seq_2558_cole_01";"This wasn't always desert: once there was more than enough water here."
"_seq_2558_stina_01";"How do you know?"
"_seq_2558_cole_02";"That's a dried up riverbed over there. I say we should follow it."
"_seq_2558_stina_02";"And quickly. Our followers aren't going to give us much more time."
"_seq_2551_bela_01";"This looks like the perfect place for a harbor."
"_seq_2561_cole_01";"Yo, where the hell'd they come from? Thin air?!"
"_seq_2561_bela_01";"I suspect they followed the river bed right up to our door."
"_seq_2564_cole_01";"I can smell the city from here. All we gotta do is kick that camp over there."
"_seq_2564_stina_01";"I'd be happier if we could find an easier way in."
"_seq_2565_bela_01";"I love it when a plan works. The outpost didn't even notice our arrival."
"_seq_2565_stina_01";"If we're quick we can reach the gate before they attack."
"_seq_2565_cole_01";"Why not just hit 'em from behind? Like, eliminate the problem."
"_seq_2557_bela_01";"This is an excellent spot for our new base."
"_seq_2557_stina_01";"And then we'll prepare our attack on these water thieves."
"_seq_2566_cole_01";"Now, thas what I'm talkin' about. One down. So what's next?"
"_seq_2566_stina_01";"Either we cut off their supply lines and sneak around to the back of the temple or we do it your way."
"_seq_2566_cole_02";"And just what is MY way?"
"_seq_2566_bela_01";"Full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes."
"_seq_2573_cole_01";"What y'all waitin' for? Let's trash the temple!"
"_seq_2573_bela_01";"What would you say to our first going around the hill and taking out any guards we might find?"
"_seq_2573_cole_02";"Sounds boring, but it might prove useful."
"_seq_2568_stina_01";"Problem seen, problem solved. That's all the troops on this side accounted for, too."
"_seq_2552_cole_01";"Say what? I thought we took care of those pirates, like, permanently?!"
"_seq_2552_stina_01";"It would seem there are still a couple of… leftovers."
"_seq_2552_cole_02";"A couple? Bro, thassa whole friggin' horde."
"_seq_2552_bela_01";"Don't talk, my friends - run!"
"_seq_2553_dustrider_sentry_01";"Halt – You have no business being here. I'll give you one minute to leave our territory. If you are still here at the end of that minute - we will throw you out."
"_seq_2562_dustrider_worker_01";"Help! Please help us! Monsters! Hordes of them. Galliminus. They were huge. They almost tore us apart."
"_seq_2562_stina_01";"A Gallimimus herd close by? We must help. We have to find their nest and take it out before they do some serious damage."
"_seq_2563_cole_01";"The only good Gallimimus is a dead Gallimimus. I hereby declare this area to be pacified. Now we can get back to work."
"_seq_2560_stina_00";"That was a close shave."
"_seq_2560_cole_00";"What I'd like to know, is who provided the friendly artillery support?"
"_seq_2560_cole_01";"Yo, dude, mad scientist city, or what?"
"_seq_2560_bela_01";"Or a genius' workshop."
"_seq_2560_bela_02";"You should probably turn that off."
"_seq_2560_taslov_01";"But why?"
"_seq_2560_taslov_02";"Don't you like coffee?"
"_seq_2560_bela_03";"You… You are…"
"_seq_2560_taslov_03";"… in just the right mood for a nice cup of coffee."
"_seq_2560_bela_04";"So, just how did you end up here, Nikolaj?"
"_seq_2560_taslov_04";"The SEAS offered me a research project. They wanted me to build a machine capable of opening a gateway\nbetween the worlds whenever desired. But Babbage wanted to conquer this world. With the knowledge from our\nworld, he would be god here. I was so enraged I destroyed everything. And for that, I was banished."
"_seq_2560_bela_05";"But Nikolaj, haven't you ever tried to rebuild the machine?"
"_seq_2560_taslov_05";"Naturally."
"_seq_2560_taslov_06";"All I need now is electricity, but there isn't any, here. There isn't even lightning."
"_seq_2560_bela_06";"Why don't you join forces with us, em… Nikolaj?"
"_seq_2560_stina_01";"You could help us bring water to the desert, and we could help you find a way home"
"_seq_2560_taslov_07";"Okay. Agreed. But it won't be easy. The Dustriders have dammed the river at their temple,\nand it's very well-defended. I have just enough water for my coffee."
"_seq_2560_cole_02";"No problem man – now let's go play plumber!"
"_seq_2572_taslov_01";"That should be enough towers."
"_seq_2567_stina_01";"Quickly, we have to open the sluice gates."
"_seq_2567_taslov_01";"Ok, I'll take care of it."
"_seq_2567_cole_01";"Am I the only one with, like, a really bad feeling about that noise?"
"_seq_2567_taslov_02";"Water in the desert! We did it!"
"_seq_2567_stina_02";"And we will  find the way home."
"_seq_2567_taslov_03";"I'll just pack a few things. We should take the gateway machine at all costs."
"_seq_2567_bela_01";"Could we take the coffee machine, as well?!"
"_seq_2567_cole_02";"What the hell is that? Invasion of the Steamrollers?"
"_seq_2567_bela_02";"Mechanical spiders – fascinating. I don't think, that bows and arrows will be of much use against these monsters."
"_seq_2567_taslov_04";"But my towers should prove to be quite effective. Strategically placed,\na few of them should provide the SEAS with a most… unpleasant surprise."
"_seq_2580_babbit_01";"Good evening, Governor."
"_seq_2580_mayor_01";"To what do I owe the honor?"
"_seq_2580_babbit_02";"Your boundless stupidity."
"_seq_2580_mayor_02";"Stupidity? No one dares talk to me like that."
"_seq_2580_babbit_03";"No one? Not even the man who has given you everything? Power… influence… all your privileges?"
"_seq_2580_mayor_03";"I wasn't thinking…"
"_seq_2580_babbit_04";"No! You didn't think. Correct. Thinking is not your strong point, is it now?\nthat's why we still have those three troublemakers on our hands."
"_seq_2580_mayor_04";"The next time I will kill them…"
"_seq_2580_babbit_05";"The next time, WE'LL take care of them. By ourselves, since it would seem you are incapable of doing so. For\n now, just do as I tell you: Think up some excuse for sending them to the temple ruins. And keep\none thing very firmly in mind: if these so-called 'heroes' actually do reach their goal, our days are numbered."
"_seq_2580_mayor_05";"Yes, sire."
"_seq_2580_mayor_06";"You've fulfilled the prophecy. Thus it would seem I was right: You ARE the chosen ones. Now all we have\nto do is convince the council of this. As for myself I am certain once you've fulfilled the second prophecy they'll\nbelieve in you too. The second one is: You must lead the lost prophet out of the darkness and into the light."
"_seq_2580_stina_07";"Get to the point: The  next test."
"_seq_2580_mayor_08";"One of our brothers was on a pilgrimage to worship at a sacred place deep in the jungle… \nwhen he suddenly disappeared. Since then, we haven't found a single trace of him."
"_seq_2580_cole_01";"And you think, the council will believe we're the ones, if we bring that pilgrim back?"
"_seq_2580_mayor_09";"Indubitably . For my part, I'll arrange  a guide for you who knows the island like no other."
"_seq_2580_kleemann_01";"I'm greatly honoured at the chance to accompany you."
"_seq_2590_kleemann_01";"There, in the mountains, lies Valhalla. At the end of Valhalla lies the Fountain of Providence.\nAll, who drink of it are released from their pain and suffering forever."
"_seq_2590_cole_01";"Pretty mystical."
"_seq_2590_bela_01";"Is that the shortest way to the old temple, Heinrich?"
"_seq_2590_kleemann_02";"The valley leads to a bridge, which in turn ends very close to the ruins.\nUnfortunately, this route is not without danger."
"_seq_2590_cole_02";"Now THAT sounds more interesting."
"_seq_2599_cole_01";"Barbarians? What a surprise."
"_seq_2599_kleemann_01";"These warriors protect the Valley of the Gods and its secrets."
"_seq_2599_stina_01";"You know, that information would have been useful in planning this misson."
"_seq_2592_kleemann_01";"Excellent, the plateau is ours."
"_seq_2592_cole_01";"Too bad those biters are warned now."
"_seq_2592_bela_01";"The counter-attacks shouldn't be long in coming."
"_seq_2592_stina_01";"then we're going to have to scout their positions and attack before they do."
"_seq_2581_cole_01";"They're attacking from the water. We gotta stop 'em from reclaiming this area."
"_seq_2583_cole_01";"This obelisk is made of a type of onyx. Yet I've never seen a specimen this big before.."
"_seq_2583_kleemann_01";"There are a total of three obelisks blocking the gateway to Valhalla. Each of these bears a runic inscription.\nOnly someone able to read these inscriptions will be able to move the obelisks."
"_seq_2583_stina_01";"And you can read these runes?"
"_seq_2583_kleemann_02";"If you can give me a few moments it shouldn't be a problem."
"_seq_2582_cole_01";"Thats one danger that ain't no mo'."
"_seq_2582_bela_01";"That should give us the time we need to train some new troops and prepare for the assault on the main camp."
"_seq_2595_kleemann_01";"What an underhanded little mechanism…"
"_seq_2595_bela_01";"What happened?"
"_seq_2595_kleemann_02";"I seem to have started a countdown. Unless I succeed in unraveling this runic puzzle the obelisk will be destroyed, closing the gateway to Valhalla for evermore."
"_seq_2595_bela_02";"Then concentrate. We'll keep them off your back."
"_seq_2584_kleemann_01";"One last obelisk. We're almost there."
"_seq_2584_stina_01";"Do you really know what awaits us in Valhalla?"
"_seq_2584_kleemann_02";"Don't worry! I've studied the ancient texts most exhaustively."
"_seq_2585_kleemann_01";"In but a few seconds the way to Valhalla shall be free."
"_seq_2585_cole_01";"Somehow I have the strangest feeling."
"_seq_2586_cole_01";"Just when you think you've seen everything."
"_seq_2586_bela_01";"I never was a fan of zombie movies."
"_seq_2586_stina_01";"I just hope that we can stop these monsters somehow."
"_seq_3004_dustrider_01a";"Wait!"
"_seq_3004_stina_01";"What's wrong? Come on."
"_seq_3004_dustrider_01b";"This place is cursed."
"_seq_3004_cole_01";"Oh, man. Then just stay here if you're chicken."
"_seq_3004_dustrider_02";"Oh, thank you. Thank all the Gods. We will wait here for you."
"_seq_3004_cole_02";"Huh? Listen…"
"_seq_3004_kleemann_01";"Let them stay. We'll find other helpers"
"_seq_3006_kleemann_01";"Finally – this path leads to Valhalla."
"_seq_3006_cole_01";"So what we waitin' for?"
"_seq_3006_kleemann_02";"It would be better if we continued to be vigilant. Legends tell of a final test before one enters the valley."
"_seq_3005_cole_01";"Hey! Where does he think he's goin'?"
"_seq_3005_stina_01";"Stop right there!"
"_seq_3005_kleemann_01";"Thank you for your assistance. This fountain will give me eternal youth.\nUnfortunately for you, our ways part here - forever."
"_seq_3005_cole_02";"He's mine."
"_seq_3005_bela_01";"Cole – first things first."
"_seq_3005_cole_03";"Another Rockgroup?"
"_seq_3005_bela_02";"Yes. Smashing!"
"_seq_3007_kleemann_01";"How did you enjoy your first taste of my new powers? I just happen to have an encore for you."
"_seq_3007_cole_01";"I've had enough of him."
"_seq_3008_kleemann_01";"It looks like my toys are wearing you down."
"_seq_3008_cole_01";"Yeah? Well, it's two-nothin' for us so far, loser. And those statues of yours ain't nothin' but abstract art now."
"_seq_3008_kleemann_02";"Fortunately, I have another helper waiting in the wings, Mr. Cole."
"_seq_3008_bela_01";"Cole, why can't you learn to just keep your mouth shut?"
"_seq_3009_cole_01";"Have a taste of your own medicine."
"_seq_3009_kleemann_01";"I haven't given up yet!"

"_seq_single_09_cole_1";""
"_seq_3011_kleemann_01";"This is your last chance to surrender."
"_seq_3011_stina_01";"Too kind. But I think we'll end this here and now – our way."
"_seq_3026_cole_01";"What? How come those guys always beat us there?"
"_seq_3026_bela_01";"A very good question, and one we should keep in mind."
"_seq_3026_stina_01";"I'm a little more interested in what they're up to this time."
"_seq_3025_cole_01";"Call it: fly, or swim?"
"_seq_3025_bela_01";"We could build a new bridge. In one or two months it could be as good as new."
"_seq_3025_cole_02";"Then it's decided: we look for another route."
"_seq_3025_stina_01";"For once I have to agree."
"_seq_3020_bela_01";"The Barbarians are slaughtering the villagers. Quick, we have to save them!"
"_seq_3024_stina_01";"Even in this world superstition creates monsters."
"_seq_3024_bela_01";"But you must admit these animals look frightening enough."
"_seq_3024_stina_02";"Something we should take advantage of."
"_seq_3023_bela_01";"We should scout the area from the water. The Dragon Clan says, there are a number of bays south of here."
"_seq_3023_dragon_clan_01";"Oh no, you can't go there. A monster lies in wait for all those who venture into the blue lagoon."
"_seq_3023_stina_01";"I think I'd like to take a closer look at this 'monster'."
"_seq_3030_dragon_clan_01";"Thank you. Without your help we would have been lost."
"_seq_3030_cole_01";"We're just happy we were in the right place at the right time."
"_seq_3030_bela_01";"Look, that could be part of an old airplane.  Where did you get this, my friend?"
"_seq_3030_dragon_clan_02";"A long time ago, a huge bird appeared. Its wings shone in the sun. It was badly wounded and screamed,\nas it fell into the jungle. Many have since made the pilgrimage to its place of rest\nand have brought back a piece of its body."
"_seq_3030_stina_01";"Sounds like a plane crash."
"_seq_3030_bela_02";"I have an idea…"
"_seq_3030_cole_02";"What do you want with an old wreck?"
"_seq_3030_bela_03";"I am sure I could use it to built a glider – if the right parts are still there."
"_seq_3030_dragon_clan_03";"It won't be easy to get the other tribes to give up their trophies. But you can count on my tribe's help."
"_seq_3030_cole_03";"Sounds like I got a new job."
"_seq_3021_stina_01";"The Barbarians are guaranteed to come back again."
"_seq_3021_bela_01";"Then we should prepare a few surprises for them. Some traps perhaps?"
"_seq_3029_cole_01";"That's one! Cole's aircraft junkyard is open for business."
"_seq_3029_bela_01";"But this junk will get us to the next island."
"_seq_3031_bela_01";"I think we have enough parts – now we have to find the wreck."
"_seq_3031_cole_01";"Chill, homeboy. We'll find it."
"_seq_3032_cole_01";"That's that. We're now the proud owners of a big pile of scrap metal."
"_seq_3032_stina_01";"Can you repair it?"
"_seq_3032_bela_01";"No, there are still a few pieces missing."
"_seq_3034_stina_01";"I'm afraid we won't be able to hold this beach for long."
"_seq_3034_bela_01";"We need these resources. We'll have to fortify this place."
"_seq_3033_stina_01";"What do you think, Béla, can we get this bird back in the sky?"
"_seq_3033_bela_01";"Definitely! We're going to have to build a launch ramp, though. That's going to require a lot of supplies."
"_seq_3033_stina_02";"And we'll have to prevent the Barbarians from re-taking the machine."
"_seq_3033_cole_01";"No prob. You just get that thing back in the air."
"_seq_3035_bela_01";"Here they come! The Barbarians are on their way!"
"_seq_3035_stina_01";"Don't they ever get enough?"
"_seq_3035_cole_01";"Let's ruin their appetite - forever."
"_seq_3040_bela_01";"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcome aboard our flight.\nOur flying time today will amount to approximately… thirty seconds."
"_seq_3040_bela_02";"I'd have never have thought the old bird would still be so agile."
"_seq_3040_cole_01";"Look over there.  Hey, Stina, what kind of bird is that?"
"_seq_3040_stina_01";"A pteranodon."
"_seq_3040_cole_02";"Hey, little guy, wha'cha doin'? You'd better get out of the road before you get hurt!"
"_seq_3040_bela_03";"Where the devil did they come from? Hold on tight!"
"_seq_3040_bela_04";"She's going down!"
"_seq_3040_cole_03b";"Man, I don't believe this!…"
"_seq_3040_bela/stina/cole_01";"Oooooohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"
"_seq_3040_bela_05";"Please remain seated with your seatbelts fastened until…"
"_seq_3040_cole_03c";"Pull up, man, pull up!"
"_seq_3040_bela_06";"She's not responding. I can't hold her any longer!"
"_seq_3040_cole_03";"… all of the pieces have come to a standstill, thank you very much."
"_seq_3040_stina_02";"We hope you had a pleasant flight!"
"_seq_3070_bela_01";"The ancient temple, right?"
"_seq_3070_stina_01";"Uhuh."
"_seq_3070_bela_02";"A place of quiet repose and meditation."
"_seq_3070_stina_02";"That's what they say."
"_seq_3070_bela_03";"We'll need more troops if we want to go in there."
"_seq_3070_stina_03";"I'd say so, too."
"_seq_3076_seas_01";"HALT!"
"_seq_3077_seas_01";"WHO GOES THERE?!"
"_seq_3078_seas_01";"STOP!"
"_seq_3079_seas_01";"ALARM!"
"_seq_3045_bela_01";"We must hurry. One of their scouts spotted us. If he sounds the alarm, we're finished."
"_seq_3045_stina_01";"Come on – let's take him out, then."
"_seq_3075_cole_01";"That fight was a little too easy for my taste."
"_seq_3075_bela_01";"Don't worry, reinforcements should be here soon."
"_seq_3075_stina_01";"At the latest when their scouts fail to return."
"_seq_3075_cole_02";"Yo, mo see how many the SEAS got left."
"_seq_3085_bela_01";"Now the SEAS must know exactly who they're dealing with."
"_seq_3085_cole_01";"Well we better take out their outposts quickly."
"_seq_3085_stina_01";"This way we can keep them off our backs, too."
"_seq_3080_cole_01";"After him!"
"_seq_3080_stina_01";"Dino treats! With a prize in every box."
"_seq_3080_warden_01";"I really must ask you to proceed more quietly in future. We're in the middle of the breeding season."
"_seq_3080_cole_02";"Riiiight. Breedin' season. Sorry 'bout that, bro. Happens all the time."
"_seq_3080_bela_01";"That was your dinosaur just now, was it not?"
"_seq_3080_stina_02";"Thank you for your timely help."
"_seq_3080_warden_02";"My pleasure. I'm delighted to see someone finally teach the SEAS a lesson."
"_seq_3080_stina_03";"You know about the SEAS?"
"_seq_3080_warden_03";"Villains. An evolutionary deadend."
"_seq_3080_stina_04";"You're James Warden? You've become a legend! Your theories changed the world."
"_seq_3080_warden_04";"Really? Phenomenal. I would have loved to have experienced that myself."
"_seq_3080_stina_05";"We must talk.  Would you like to join us for dinner? You share the same fate as our friend Taslow."
"_seq_3080_warden_05";"Taslow is with you? Then it would be a singular honor, indeed."
"_seq_3086_bela_01";"If we want to go through the main gate we're going to need a lot more warriors."
"_seq_3086_cole_01";"Chill, bro. You ain't never seen me really kick it, yet."
"_seq_3086_warden_01";"…and die.  fortunately we have an alternative. Carnivorous dinosaurs live close to the SEAS base and attack anything that comes near."
"_seq_3086_cole_02";"You call that an alternative?"
"_seq_3086_warden_02";"They won't hurt me. I can get you safely past them and into the base."
"_seq_3086_stina_01";"Excellent. I'll join you."
"_seq_3086_warden_03";"No, this I must do alone. Yours is another path to walk, Stina."
"_seq_3083_warden_01";"The gate is open. Enjoy your meal. I hope the SEAS don't give you indigestion."
"_seq_3090_leighton_01";"…and he will speak peace to the nations: and his dominion will be from ocean to ocean, and from the river\nto the ends of the earth… I assume you have eliminated the offworlders, Heinrich?"
"_seq_3090_cole_01";"Forgot one, bro."
"_seq_3090_stina_01";"Unfortunately we had to leave dear Heinrich back in the Icewaste.\nThe governor will be disappointed to learn that his henchmen are so incompetent."
"_seq_3090_leighton_02";"Me? A henchman for the governor? Ridiculous. I am the voice of the SEAS in this world,\nits mighty arm and the sword which crushes all resistance."
"_seq_3090_bela_01";"I'm certain the Council will find this information just as fascinating as we do."
"_seq_4010_mayor_01";"…those young people in whom we'd placed so much hope have failed to return. Most unfortunate.\nPersonally, their loss fills me with an overwhelming sense of grief."
"_seq_4010_cole_01";"We too are filled with deep dismay."
"_seq_4010_cole_02";"This man told us everything. The governor has lied and double-crossed you. He has abused your trust\nand betrayed the best interests of the Holy City."
"_seq_4010_crowd_01";""
"_seq_4010_council_member_1_01";"What an affront! Such insolence!"
"_seq_4010_stina_01";"You know, what Cole says is true. This man is the head of a gang of thugs who call themselves the SEAS.\nThey have seized control of your world, undermining it, destroying it from within."
"_seq_4010_council_member_1_01b";"Is that true?"
"_seq_4010_mayor_02";"You believe those contemptuous, ignorant…"
"_seq_4010_cole_03";"…chosen ones!"
"_seq_4010_mayor_03";"You don't believe me? After I have served you so faithfully all these years?"
"_seq_4010_council_member_1_02";"Silence! Silence in the chamber! The council in its infinite wisdom has reached a decision: You will resolve your \ndispute… in the arena! We demand a trial by ordeal."
"_seq_4011_bela_01";"It will be interesting to see how the Gods judge one here."
"_seq_4011_stina_01";"If this world is anything like our own it probably won't be fun."
"_seq_4011_cole_01";"We'll see about that."
"_seq_4012_cole_01";"Is that it?"
"_seq_4012_bela_01";"That was just round one, my friend."
"_seq_4013_bela_01";"Which round was that?"
"_seq_4013_stina_01";"The one right before the really big predators enter the arena."
"_seq_4013_cole_01";"I guess it's too late to change our minds, right?"
"_seq_4014_bela_01";"Ready, aim, fire – ready, aim, fire. I'm not a damn machine."
"_seq_4014_stina_01";"Would you prefer attack, fall down, get eaten alive?"
"_seq_4016_cole_01";"Anyone have an idea how long a God needs to make one of these decisions?"
"_seq_4016_bela_01";"I could probably calculate that - later."
"_seq_4016_cole_02";"Thanks, but no need."
"_seq_4025_bela_00";"This must be the Island, Leighton told us about."
"_seq_4025_cole_01";"Looks like Leighton lied to us. There isn't any tower here."
"_seq_4025_bela_01";"But there is a ruin, and one we can and should repair."
"_seq_4025_stina_01";"I saw signs of ships down on the beach. I'm afraid the SEAS were already here."
"_seq_4025_cole_02";"Hope they come back. I got a couple of arguments that are bound to be a hit."
"_seq_4025_bela_02";"At any rate, we must stop them from reaching the tower while it's under repair."
"_seq_4026_cole_01";"No matter where we go – the SEAS always manage to beat us there."
"_seq_4026_bela_01";"Rather like the Tortoise and the Hare."
"_seq_4026_stina_01";"No. The SEAS are more of a botanical problem: they're like bad weeds – they pop up everywhere!"
"_seq_4027_stina_01";"It is good to see you again."
"_seq_4027_dustrider_01";"We, too, are happy that we once more walk the same path."
"_seq_4027_bela_01";"You will have to increase your defences. Heavily armed SEAS ships are already on their way here."
"_seq_4027_dustrider_02";"Will you fight them?"
"_seq_4027_cole_01";"Yo. Bet on that, bro."
"_seq_4027_dustrider_03";"Then we shall help."
"_seq_4027_bela_02";"Good. First off, you should improve your defenses."
"_seq_4028_cole_01";"Fate is smilin' on Mama's only boy today. Here come's the backup we need."
"_seq_4028_norsemen_01";"It goes without saying that we'd be more than happy to provide any help we can."
"_seq_4032_dustrider_01";"Quickly! They are attacking your base. We'll try to delay them as best we can."
"_seq_4033_stina_01";"Anyone who can count warriors such as yourselves amongst their friends is lucky indeed."
"_seq_4033_dustrider_01";"You would have done no less for us."
"_seq_4030_cole_01";"And? Can you see the stars, or what?"
"_seq_4030_bela_01";"Easy, my friend. I have to make a few adjustments, first."
"_seq_4030_cole_02";"What's wrong?"
"_seq_4030_bela_02";"Oh no, that's impossible!"
"_seq_4030_stina_01";"Is something sticking?"
"_seq_4030_bela_03";"No, it works splendidly. I just don't like what I see! It looks like the entire bloody SEAS fleet!"
"_seq_4030_cole_03";"What do they want now?"
"_seq_4030_stina_02";"I think it's called 'gun-boat diplomacy'."
"_seq_4030_cole_04";"Then we'd better improve our bargaining position."
"_seq_4030_stina_03";"We should sink as many of their ships as possible before the SEAS attack the Holy City."
"_seq_4029_stina_01";"From here one has a great view of the sea."
"_seq_4029_bela_01";"Not only that. If we erect some towers at these locations the SEAS won't be able to get any carriers past without taking some damage."
"_seq_4034_cole_01";"Man, this is like tilting against windmills."
"_seq_4034_bela_01";"Cheer up. Every carrier we can stop from reaching the Holy City is a success in its own right."
"_seq_4036_stina_01";"If any more carriers get through our defenses, the Holy City is doomed."
"_seq_4036_cole_01";"Then I guess we'd better make sure that just doesn't happen."
"_seq_4031_bela_01";"How do the SEAS always know what we're doing?"
"_seq_4031_stina_01";"Maybe they're watching us. The question is – where from?"
"_seq_4031_norsemen_01";"A group of their leaders live on an island close to our village."
"_seq_4031_cole_01";"I think it's time we got to know these officers and gentlemen a little more closely."
"_seq_4037_bela_01";"Mission accomplished. The SEAS officers have been eliminated."
"_seq_4037_stina_01";"That should make things easier."
"_seq_4038_cole_01";"There're a lot of ships out there."
"_seq_4038_bela_01";"Too many, we won't be able to stop them all."
"_seq_4038_stina_01";"Then we'd better prepare the Holy City for the attack."
"_seq_4070_bela_01";"It's time. Our outposts are already under attack. Now it's up to us. We have to hold the gate at all costs."
"_seq_4070_cole_01";"Alright, people. Time to push the SEAS and their machines back to the ocean."
"_seq_4070_bela_02";"They're guaranteed to use the old pilgrimage route."
"_seq_4070_cole_02";"Then we'll just have to make the trip a little tougher than the others. Let's harden that route."
"_seq_single_15_leighton_13";"Destroy any resistance! No prisoners, no survivors!"
"_seq_single_15_leighton_17";"A new world order is upon us!"
"_seq_4085_cole_01";"Looks like things are cool here."
"_seq_4085_bela_01";"Which makes me a little uneasy."
"_seq_4085_cole_02";"You thinkin' what I'm thinkin', bro'?"
"_seq_4085_bela_02";"Unless I'm terribly mistaken I think we had better prepare for a large-scale attack."
"_seq_4083_bela_01";"Sometimes I truly hate being right."
"_seq_4083_stina_01";"Chin up. If we can stop the SEAS here and now, we'll have the worst of it behind us."
"_seq_4073_stina_01";"Finally. Here come the Dustriders with reinforcements."
"_seq_4073_cole_01";"Now that's what I'D call in the nick of time."
"_seq_4073_bela_01";"Better late than never. Now for the counter-attack."
"_seq_4075_flying_trader_01";"Hey, down there. Can you hear me?"
"_seq_4075_bela_01";"Terribly sorry. I'm afraid it's really incovenient right now. I have to win this little war, first. You know how it is."
"_seq_4075_flying_trader_02";"How about a few RESOURCES, then?"
"_seq_4075_bela_02";"Excellent."
"_seq_4075_flying_trader_03";"Okay, then clear me a landing spot down there."
"_seq_4075_bela_03";"That could take a bit! We're drawing heavy fire."
"_seq_4075_flying_trader_04";"Don't take too long. Once the SEAS get ranged in on my zeppelin it'll all be too late."
"_seq_4076_flying_trader_01";"I don't want to seem ungrateful, or anything, but the air up here is starting to show an extremely high concentration of lead."
"_seq_4076_bela_01";"We're doing our best. It'll just be a moment."
"_seq_4078_flying_trader_01";"Good work. I'll just unload these resources, then."
"_seq_4078_bela_01";"Shouldn't we discuss the price?"
"_seq_4078_flying_trader_02";"After all you've done for my brothers and me the first load is on the house."
"_seq_4078_bela_02";"I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"_seq_4079_flying_trader_01";"Sorry, friends, but things are getting a little too hot for me. I've gotta go."
"_seq_4079_bela_01";"There goes our best hope for re-supply."
"_seq_4092_cole_01";"Looks like they've dug themselves in everywhere, cuz."
"_seq_4092_stina_01";"Then I guess we should scout out their bases and take them out."
"_seq_4093_cole_01";"That's that. We've taken out all of their outposts. Time to kick back and chill a bit."
"_seq_4088_stina_01";"I was beginnin' to think it would never end."
"_seq_4088_cole_01";"It never will, either. They'll keep attacking us as long as they have one base intact."
"_seq_4088_bela_01";"We could make our lives much easier by taking out their outposts."
"_seq_4088_stina_02";"Do you have a plan?"
"_seq_4088_bela_02";"Our scouts have located a poorly protected outpost to the east."
"_seq_4088_cole_02";"Béla, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west! Lets grab some troops and erase the outpost in the… West!"
"_seq_4072_cole_01";"The Norsemen are coming to help us. Together we'll be able to annihilate the SEAS."
"_seq_4072_norsemen_01";"Let's get 'em!"
"_seq_4084_cole_01";"Good fight. Thanks, my friends."
"_seq_4084_norsemen_01";"It is good to once again fight side-by-side with you."
"_seq_4077_stina_01";"We weren't fast enough. The SEAS have sent fresh reinforcements to that outpost in the west."
"_seq_4077_bela_01";"Then we'll have to train more troops to take them out."
"_seq_4089_cole_01";"We can't hold the outposts against the numbers the SEAS are throwin' at us."
"_seq_4089_bela_01";"Quick! We have to gather our troops and counter-attack before they build a base on our doorstep."
"_seq_4090_bela_01";"Excellent, the area is ours once more."
"_seq_4090_cole_01";"I'll look after the defenses. That ain't gonna happen twice, bro."
"_seq_4094_cole_01";"Yo, where the hell are they coming from now?"
"_seq_4094_bela_01";"The beach. I think the SEAS are using ships to transport their troops here."
"_seq_4094_stina_01";"Then we should either take out their ships, or better yet, the SEAS harbor."
"_seq_4095_bela_01";"Without their transport ships they cannot attack from the water anymore."
"_seq_4095_stina_01";"Which gives us as much time as we need to prepare for the grand finale."
"_seq_4096_stina_01";"James? Where are you going?"
"_seq_4096_warden_01";"I'm going to put a few nests in the SEAS' path. The dilophosaurs should prove a tremendous obstacle when they hatch."
"_seq_4096_stina_02";"Be careful!"
"_seq_4097_warden_01";"I'm sure my pets will surprise the SEAS no end."
"_seq_4086_cole_01";"Where are the SEAS gettin' all their resources?"
"_seq_4086_bela_01";"There must be a warehouse somewhere. Life would be a great deal easier if we could find it."
"_seq_4086_cole_02";"True that, bro. Your plan."
"_seq_4087_cole_01";"There go the SEAS supplies up in smoke."
"_seq_4087_bela_01";"I have never seen a cheerier bonfire."
"_seq_4074_cole_01";"Run, bastards, run!"
"_seq_4074_bela_01";"We really did it! We have beaten the SEAS!"
"_seq_4074_stina_01";"Don't halloo till you're out of the wood!"
"_seq_4074_bela_02";"We can not allow them to attack the city again!"
"_seq_6020_soldier_01";"Retreat!"
"_seq_6020_leighton_01";"See, the day of the Lord is coming\n – a cruel day with wrath and fierce anger – \nto make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it."
"_seq_6020_leighton_02";"Were you not the one who said: 'Only the fittest shall survive'?"
"_seq_6020_bela_01";"The least he deserves is a decent burial. Then we'll gather our troops."
"_seq_6020_cole_01";"Yes. And then it's time to end this once and for all."
"_seq_6050_cole_01";"He's not gettin' away this time."
"_seq_6050_stina_01";"No, but he's not going to make it easy for us, either."
"_seq_7042_cole_01";"Ada ís alive."
"_seq_7042_bela_01";"Although she does seem to be in a great deal of trouble."
"_seq_7042_cole_02";"We've gotta rescue her."
"_seq_7042_stina_01";"And maybe then we'll finally get some answers to our questions."
"_seq_6100_loudspeakers_01";"CODE RED – I repeat: CODE RED.Our base is under attack. All units are to report immediately to your posts."
"_seq_6101_cole_01";"Pretty impressive defenses the SEAS have there."
"_seq_6101_bela_01";"We should proceed systematically. First we destroy the outlying defenses and bunkers and then we take out the main complex."
"_seq_6102_bela_01";"They really must learn that you can't just run from your problems."
"_seq_6102_stina_01";"Maybe we should concentrate on the prison and leave the group therapy for later."
"_seq_6103_bela_01";"For a Victorian old boy's club, our adversaries have some impressive weaponry at their command."
"_seq_6103_cole_01";"We're gonna have to take out these machineguns."
"_seq_6104_cole_01";"Bunkers, just great. You guys ever see 'Saving Private Ryan' ?"Habt ihr
"_seq_6104_bela_01";"Yes, but they didn't have dinosaurs. We must take out those emplacements one way or another."
"_seq_6105_bela_01";"That coward. He's running away!"
"_seq_6105_cole_01";"Scumbag! I wanna get my hands around that scrawny neck and wring, baby."
"_seq_6105_stina_01";"I'm sure the day will come, but first we have to rescue Ada."
"_seq_6106_bela_01";"That coward. He's running away!"
"_seq_6106_cole_01";"Not again. I wanna finally wrap my hands around that scrawny neck and wring."
"_seq_6106_stina_01";"I'm sure the day will come, but first we have to rescue these prisoners. We can't leave anyone behind."
"_seq_6107_bela_01";"Excellent, that should help our attack considerably."
"_seq_6108_stina_01";"We found their headquarters."
"_seq_6108_bela_01";"And therefore Leighton, too, most probably."
"_seq_6108_stina_02";"That would explain the overkill on the defenses."
"_seq_6109_stina_01";"That puts a definite crimp on their striking power."
"_seq_6109_cole_01";"Then its time to drag our friend Leighton outta there."
"_seq_7020_cole_01";"What I don't get is why the SEAS are doing all this."
"_seq_7020_ada_01";"Frankly, I think they've gone mad. That idiot Jarvis wants to close the gateway between the worlds forever by blasting the planet a little ways out of its normal orbit."
"_seq_7020_stina_01";"And how does he intend to knock a whole planet out of its orbit?"
"_seq_7020_ada_02";"by using a gigantic jet he's built  inside a volcanic crater."
"_seq_7020_bela_01";"But  that's insane."
"_seq_7020_stina_02";"The whole ecosystem will collapse. A catastrophe of unimaginable proportions "
"_seq_7020_ada_03";"It gets worse. Now that I've escaped he won't wait long before igniting it."
"_seq_7020_stina_03";"…somehow we have to get inside the SEAS headquarters and put an end to their megalomania."
"_seq_7020_bela_02";"But first we should allow ourselves a few hours well-earned rest . Good night."
"_seq_7020_stina_04";"Excellent thinking, Béla, I'm dead tired too. Good night."
"_seq_7020_ada_04";"Funny, but I'm not the least bit tired anymore. Just cold."
"_seq_7020_cole_03";"Well, now, darling. Cole got just the right prescription for that!"
"_seq_7010_taslov_01";"Do you think it'll work?"
"_seq_7010_bela_01";"As long as your theory is correct, yes."
"_seq_7010_taslov_02";"Very funny, son! However I hope we'll find a… what did you call it?…\nA computer on the island capable of performing the necessary calculations."
"_seq_7010_ada_01";"Babbit's differential machine might do the job. He uses it to control the jet.\nSo all we have to do is get into the crater."
"_seq_7010_taslov_03";"Into the crater? That sounds like a real challenge."
"_seq_7010_bela_02";"I know you'd rather perform the calculations in your head, but there just isn't enough time."
"_seq_7011_cole_01";"We're hardly on the beach and the SEAS are already knocking on the door."
"_seq_7011_stina_01";"Then why don't you invite our guests in?"
"_seq_7013_cole_01";"And that's the end of Leighton. Wish him well on his way to the hereafter."
"_seq_7013_stina_01";"Could be a hell of a trip."
"_seq_7013_bela_01";"Oh, please – he'd run away from the devil himself, too."
"_seq_7012_bela_01";"I can't see any weaknesses in their defenses."
"_seq_7012_cole_01";"Then we'll take 'em apart piece by piece, starting with the bunkers."
"_seq_7015_bela_01";"I was right. Those were the gun controls."
"_seq_7016_bela_01";"A heavenly quiet!"
"_seq_7026_stina_01";"My God."
"_seq_7026_bela_01";"Everyone okay?"
"_seq_7027_bela_01";"He wants to fire it! We have to stop him."
"_seq_7027_cole_01";"That building must have something to do with it. We gotta get there fast!"
"_seq_7037_leighton_01";"'Vengeance is mine' sayeth the Lord."
"_seq_7037_stina_01";"Back home he'd probably push a pamphlet into our hands."
"_seq_7037_bela_01";"Come. It's about time we ended his career."
"_seq_7017_bela_01";"We're running out of time. We have to get into that crater now."
"_seq_7017_cole_01";"We're on it, bro. But somehow the SEAS just don't want to open the gates and let us in."
"_seq_7038_stina_01";"Three down, two to go."
"_seq_7014_stina_01";"Now they're taking us seriously."
"_seq_7014_bela_01";"We have to take out those guns before they can do any more damage."
"_seq_7040_bela_01";"The lion's den…"
"_seq_7040_stina_01";"If only it were lions we had to deal with!"
"_seq_single_16_stina_4";"Unbelievable…"
"_seq_add_taslov_14";"It is like looking into the jaws of hell."
"_seq_7050_babbit_01";"Welcome, welcome to my headquarters. I hope you enjoyed your brief, pathetic little moment of triumph –\nbecause none of you will leave this building alive."
"_seq_7050_bela_01";"The differential machine is up there. We need to set up our equipment right beside it."
"_seq_single_16_stina_5";"Nikolaj, now it is up to you!"
"_seq_single_16_cole_1";""
"_seq_7052_taslov_01";"There's not enough energy."
"_seq_7052_bela_01";"That mechanical monster is the problem."
"_seq_7052_taslov_02";"I'll have to reroute the power using the control panel."
"_seq_7052_bela_02";"Ok, we'll keep that thing away from you."
"_seq_single_16_bela_7";"Stay covered, Nikolaj!"
"_seq_7053_babbit_01";"I am not done with you, yet."

"_seq_7060_stina_01";"Cole, Ada, it's time to get going."
"_seq_7060_babbit_01";"Congratulations Mr. Cole. You've won…  everything, it would seem."
"_seq_7060_cole_01";"Give me your hand! We'll take you back with us."
"_seq_7060_babbit_02";"No. Your world was bad enough before you tore the secret of the gateways from me. A world, where honourable\ncombat between men has been sacrificed for wholesale destruction. Where airplanes fly faster than sound, yet no\none has the time to smell the flowers along the way. No, I fail to believe it will improve in any great measure."
"_seq_7060_ada_01";"Jarvis, take his hand!"
"_seq_7060_babbit_03";"Farewell, Ada."
"_seq_7060_babbit_04";"Till we meet again, Mr. Cole."

"_seq_7060_bela_05";"I think you should see for yourself."
