"_ds_0000_Frame_0";"This part of the jungle is known as 'Land of the Dragon Clan'. An ancient stone bridge can be found here. It is the only known way to the temple island, on which the prophet supposedly resides."
"_ds_0000_Frame_1";"Find a way to reach the temple island which lies beyond the bridge."
"_ds_1111_Frame_0";"This is text of frame 0"
"_ds_1040_Frame_0";"Stina? You okay?"
"_ds_1040_Frame_1";"Not really. There's a sweet little Eusmilus down here – and a whole pack of big, nasty, hungry Smilodons."
"_ds_1021_Frame_0";"Man, that was tight… Where the hell did HE pop up from?"
"_ds_1021_Frame_1";"You must destroy the nest before more of them come."
"_ds_1023_Frame_0";"That was very brave – thank you for your help."
"_ds_1023_Frame_1";"Ain't no thing, bro. What kinda monster was that, anyways?"
"_ds_1023_Frame_2";"Later. My village is under attack. I must go."
"_ds_1023_Frame_3";"Yo. Look, I'll give you a hand. Maybe then I'll be able to get a few answers."
"_ds_1023b_Frame_0";"That was very brave – thank you for your help."
"_ds_1026_Frame_0";"Close the gates! Stop them! Let no-one escape!"
"_ds_1026_Frame_1";"Man, doesn't the fighting ever end around here?"
"_ds_1028_Frame_0";"So, that's the last of them. Now can I ask you a few questions, or what?"
"_ds_1028_Frame_1";"I'll answer all of your questions as soon as we find my son. He was forced down towards the beach during the fighting."
"_ds_1028_Frame_2";"Naturally. Okay, okay. Fine. I'll go look for him."
"_ds_1029_Frame_0";"Yo. There're the dudes that kidnapped your friends."
"_ds_1029_Frame_1";"If we attack from here they will see us right away."
"_ds_1029_Frame_2";"Then I guess we better find a way to hit 'em from behind."
"_ds_1031_Frame_0";"Yo, baby. This thing might just prove to be very useful."
"_ds_1032_Frame_0";"By all the Gods, I can feel the power coursing through me."
"_ds_1032_Frame_1";"Looks like that thing has truly got the power..."
"_ds_1033_Frame_0";"It's a trap."
"_ds_1033_Frame_1";"They attack. Kill them all. And the prisoners."
"_ds_1034_Frame_0";"Hey, this is the perfect spot. They'll never expect an attack from this side."
"_ds_1035_Frame_0";"Help us, please! Get the Barbarians off us."
"_ds_1037_Frame_0";"You saved our lives. We are in your debt."
"_ds_1037_Frame_1";"Well, that's a word, bro, 'cause I could really use some help taking down the Barbarians, know what I mean?"
"_ds_1039_Frame_0";"Yo. Isn't that another load of those Smilodons?"
"_ds_1039_Frame_1";"Sure is. I'll just stop them before they can do any more damage."
"_ds_1039_Frame_2";"Need any help?"
"_ds_1039_Frame_3";"The spearmen should be enough."
"_ds_1039_Frame_4";"Don't forget the nest."
"_ds_1041_Frame_0";"Well, the animal population should be able to recover now."
"_ds_1041_Frame_1";"Good. Then all we gotta do now is find Béla."
"_ds_1042_Frame_0";"Thank you for freeing us. What should we do now?"
"_ds_1042_Frame_1";"Together we shall teach these barbarians a lesson they'll never forget. Ready your bows."
"_ds_1043_Frame_0";"The prisoners have escaped. Kill them!"
"_ds_1044_Frame_0";"We're under attack! To arms! To arms!"
"_ds_1045_Frame_0";"Those are prisoners - and they're armed."
"_ds_1046_Frame_0";"An attack? How did they get in here?"
"_ds_1047_Frame_0";"It would seem that we now have this camp firmly in hand."
"_ds_1048_Frame_0";"You're safe for now. Wait here until we've taken out all of the Barbarians."
"_ds_1049_Frame_0";"No, no. Not yet. Wait here. It's still much too dangerous for all of you."
"_ds_1051_Frame_0";"Very well, it's time. You may come out now, everything is under control."
"_ds_1053_Frame_0";"Well, that's a start."
"_ds_1054_Frame_0";"Now that's what I call takin' care of business. Guess it's time to get us some troops."
"_ds_1055_Frame_0";"And now it's time to kick a little Barbarian booty."
"_ds_1056_Frame_0";"Yep, I feel much safer now."
"_ds_1056_Frame_1";"You just want to drink."
"_ds_1057_Frame_0";"Now that's what I call kickin' some butt!"
"_ds_1057_Frame_1";"Yes, of course. But with so little resistance I suspect that this was only a small outpost."
"_ds_1059_Frame_0";"Man, this place would be perfect for a Halloween party."
"_ds_1059_Frame_1";"All that's missing are the candies and the little presents."
"_ds_1059_Frame_2";"I'm certain we can do something about that. Look! The crate over there!"
"_ds_1020_Frame_0";"What the?! What the hell kinda animal is that?"
"_ds_1020_Frame_1";"Fight now, talk later. Please!"
"_ds_1030_Frame_0";"You fought well. I thank you for your help, warrior."
"_ds_1030_Frame_1";"My pleasure, bro. Just one thing, though: my peeps have kinda disappeared, y'know, and I gotta find 'em."
"_ds_1030_Frame_2";"Then you should follow those who attacked us. Time and again they kidnap my warriors. Perhaps they are holding your companions captive as well."
"_ds_1030_Frame_3";"Agreed. I shall go forth and free your brothers and sisters – and hopefully find my friends."
"_ds_1070_Frame_0";"Who are those guys?"
"_ds_1070_Frame_1";"They found me on the beach. At first I thought it was just part of the training. But then... during the night they came and dragged a couple of the prisoners out of their cages and… ate them."
"_ds_1071_Frame_0";"We made it. We actually made it!"
"_ds_1071_Frame_1";"Luckily, yes. At least we're all back together again."
"_ds_1071_Frame_2";"Before we do anything else we should scout the rest of the island."
"_ds_1071_Frame_3";"Watch out for the barbarians! This is a large tribe, and you only defeated a few of them up to now!"
"_ds_1071_Frame_4";"Then I guess we had best be careful."
"_ds_1075_Frame_0";"Excellent! That's another mammoth family safe and sound. Off to the next challenge!"
"_ds_1076_Frame_0";"Done! Just one mammoth family left!"
"_ds_1100_Frame_0";"I can feel peace returning to the sacred grove."
"_ds_1100_Frame_1";"We are honored to have been of help."
"_ds_1100_Frame_2";"I have questioned the Oracle: your path leads south. There you will encounter a man – a man with a key to open the gate to your world."
"_ds_2024_Frame_0";"So. Moving day is officially over. The little shoesies are all color-sorted in their little closet."
"_ds_2024_Frame_1";"This place is perfectly suited to our needs."
"_ds_2026_Frame_0";"Larry, what are you doing here?"
"_ds_2026_Frame_1";"I'm Harry. I got a little too close to a Barbarian village with my zeppelin, and the buggers just shot me down."
"_ds_2026_Frame_2";"Anything we can do?"
"_ds_2026_Frame_3";"I was hoping you'd say that. I'm afraid the Barbarians will be here pretty soon to cart away the spoils. Just keep them off me long enough for me to fix my zeppelin."
"_ds_2026_Frame_4";"Barbarians? Oh, baby, we down for that!"
"_ds_2027_Frame_0";"Would a map of all the Barbarian bases in the area help?"
"_ds_2027_Frame_1";"Looks like we will be able to do business, after all."
"_ds_2027_Frame_2";"Here you go. Thanks for the help."
"_ds_2030_Frame_0";"We've found a group of Barbarians. They look like they're guarding something."
"_ds_2030_Frame_1";"Barbarians? Here?"
"_ds_2030_Frame_2";"It is a holy place. They drove us off. Now they are desecrating holy ground."
"_ds_2030_Frame_3";"Sounds like our old buddies the Barbarians alright."
"_ds_2030_Frame_4";"Then I guess it's time for their next lesson."
"_ds_2075_Frame_0";"Not quite how I imagined a Holy City to be."
"_ds_2076_Frame_0";"It seems not even the capital of the Free Nations is free of violence. Come – let us see what the Council can tell us."
"_ds_2551_Frame_0";"This looks like the perfect place for a harbor."
"_ds_2552_Frame_0";"Say what? I thought we took care of those pirates, like, permanently?!"
"_ds_2552_Frame_1";"It would seem there are still a couple of... leftovers."
"_ds_2552_Frame_2";"A couple? Bro, thassa whole friggin' horde."
"_ds_2552_Frame_3";"Don't talk, my friends - run!"
"_ds_2553_Frame_0";"Halt – You have no business being here. I'll give you one minute to leave our territory. If you are still here at the end of that minute - we will throw you out."
"_ds_2557_Frame_0";"This is an excellent spot for our new base."
"_ds_2557_Frame_1";"And then we'll prepare our attack on these water thieves."
"_ds_2561_Frame_0";"Yo, where the hell'd they come from? Thin air?!"
"_ds_2561_Frame_1";"I suspect they followed the river bed right up to our door."
"_ds_2562_Frame_0";"Help! Please help us! Monsters! Hordes of them. Gallimimus. They were huge. They almost tore us apart."
"_ds_2562_Frame_1";"A Gallimimus herd close by? We've gotta help. We've got to find their nest and take it out before they do some serious damage."
"_ds_2563_Frame_0";"The only good Gallimimus is a dead Gallimimus. I hereby declare this area to be pacified. Now can we get back to work?"
"_ds_2564_Frame_0";"I can smell the city from here. All we gotta do is kick that camp over there."
"_ds_2564_Frame_1";"I'd be happier if we could find an easier way in."
"_ds_2565_Frame_0";"I love it when a plan works. The outpost didn't even notice our arrival."
"_ds_2565_Frame_1";"If we're quick we can reach the gate before they attack."
"_ds_2565_Frame_2";"Why not just hit 'em from behind? Like, eliminate the problem."
"_ds_2566_Frame_0";"Now, thats what I'm talkin' about. One down. So what's next?"
"_ds_2566_Frame_1";"Either we cut off their supply lines and sneak around to the back of the temple or we do it your way."
"_ds_2566_Frame_2";"And just what is MY way?"
"_ds_2566_Frame_3";"Full speed ahead and damn the torpedoes."
"_ds_2568_Frame_0";"Problem seen, problem solved. That's all the troops on this side accounted for, too."
"_ds_2572_Frame_0";"That should be enough towers."
"_ds_2573_Frame_0";"What y'all waitin' for? Let's trash the temple!"
"_ds_2573_Frame_1";"What would you say to our first going around the hill and taking out any guards we might find?"
"_ds_2573_Frame_2";"Sounds boring, but it might prove useful."
"_ds_2575_Frame_0";"We're in. Now all we have to do is find the tap and turn the water on."
"_ds_2599_Frame_0";"Barbarians? What a surprise."
"_ds_2599_Frame_1";"These warriors protect the Valley of the Gods and its secrets."
"_ds_2599_Frame_2";"You know, that information would have been useful in planning this misson."
"_ds_2592_Frame_0";"Excellent, the plateau is ours."
"_ds_2592_Frame_1";"Too bad those biters are warned now."
"_ds_2592_Frame_2";"The counter-attacks shouldn't be long in coming."
"_ds_2592_Frame_3";"Then we're going to have to scout their positions and attack before they do."
"_ds_2581_Frame_0";"They're attacking from the water. We gotta stop 'em from reclaiming this area."
"_ds_2582_Frame_0";"That's one danger that ain't no mo'."
"_ds_2595_Frame_0";"What an underhanded little mechanism…"
"_ds_2595_Frame_1";"What happened?"
"_ds_2595_Frame_2";"I seem to have started a countdown. Unless I succeed in unraveling this runic puzzle the obelisk will be destroyed, closing the gateway to Valhalla for evermore."
"_ds_2595_Frame_3";"Then concentrate. We'll keep them off your back."
"_ds_2584_Frame_0";"One last obelisk. We're almost there."
"_ds_2584_Frame_1";"Do you really know what awaits us in Valhalla?"
"_ds_2584_Frame_2";"Don't worry! I've studied the ancient texts most exhaustively."
"_ds_2586_Frame_0";"Just when you think you've seen everything."
"_ds_2586_Frame_1";"I never was a fan of zombie movies."
"_ds_2586_Frame_2";"I just hope that we can stop these monsters somehow."
"_ds_3006_Frame_0";"Finally – this path leads to Valhalla."
"_ds_3006_Frame_1";"Let's see what awaits us up there."
"_ds_3007_Frame_0";"How did you enjoy your first taste of my new powers? I just happen to have an encore for you."
"_ds_3007_Frame_1";"I've had enough of him."
"_ds_3008_Frame_0";"It looks like my toys are wearing you down."
"_ds_3008_Frame_1";"Yeah? Well, it's two-nothin' for us so far, loser. And those statues of yours ain't nothin' but abstract art now."
"_ds_3008_Frame_2";"Fortunately I have another helper waiting in the wings, Mr. Cole."
"_ds_3008_Frame_3";"Cole, why can't you learn to just keep your mouth shut?"
"_ds_3009_Frame_0";"Have a taste of your own medicine."
"_ds_3009_Frame_1";"I haven't given up yet!"
"_ds_3011_Frame_0";"This is your last chance to surrender."
"_ds_3011_Frame_1";"Too kind. But I think we'll end this here and now – our way."
"_ds_3019_Frame_0";"After the icewaste, these islands seem like paradise to me."
"_ds_3019_Frame_1";"The climatic changes in this world are absolutely fascinating."
"_ds_3019_Frame_2";"Right. Just gimme a beer, a new surfboard and I’ll be happy."
"_ds_3020_Frame_0";"The Barbarians  are slaughtering the villagers. Quick, we have to save them."
"_ds_3021_Frame_0";"The Barbarians are guaranteed to come back again."
"_ds_3021_Frame_1";"Then we should prepare a few surprises for them. Some traps perhaps?"
"_ds_3023_Frame_0";"We should scout the area from the water. The Dragon Clan says there are a number of bays south of here."
"_ds_3023_Frame_1";"Oh no, you can't go there. A monster lies in wait for all those who venture into the blue lagoon."
"_ds_3023_Frame_2";"I think I'd like to take a closer look at this monster."
"_ds_3024_Frame_0";"Even in this world superstition creates monsters."
"_ds_3024_Frame_1";"But you must admit these animals look frightening enough."
"_ds_3024_Frame_2";"Something we should take advantage of."
"_ds_3026_Frame_0";"What? How come those guys always beat us there?"
"_ds_3026_Frame_1";"A very good question, and one we should keep in mind."
"_ds_3026_Frame_2";"I'm a little more interested in what they're up to this time."
"_ds_3029_Frame_0";"That's one! Cole's aircraft junkyard is open for business."
"_ds_3029_Frame_1";"But this junk will get us to the next island."
"_ds_3031_Frame_0";"I think we have enough parts – now we have to find the wreck."
"_ds_3031_Frame_1";"Chill, homeboy. We'll find it."
"_ds_3032_Frame_0";"That's that. We're now the proud owners of a big pile of scrap metal."
"_ds_3032_Frame_1";"Can you repair it?"
"_ds_3032_Frame_2";"No, there are still a few pieces missing."
"_ds_3034_Frame_0";"I'm afraid we won't be able to hold this beach for long."
"_ds_3034_Frame_1";"We need these resources. We'll have to fortify this place."
"_ds_3035_Frame_0";"Here they come! The Barbarians are on their way!"
"_ds_3035_Frame_1";"Don't they ever get enough?"
"_ds_3035_Frame_2";"Let’s ruin their appetite - forever."
"_ds_2040_Frame_0";"Lieutenant - cover my retreat."
"_ds_2047_Frame_0";"I'm sorry, but this inn is closed. I can't afford to let the pirates break in again."
"_ds_2051_Frame_0";"Those scoundrels! They've kidnapped my daughter. They rampage through the streets taking whatever they want. Someone has to stop them."
"_ds_2052_Frame_0";"Please help us. I've asked the council for help time and again. We need help in fighting off these bandits."
"_ds_2053_Frame_0";"The pirates break into our homes and plunder and murder. Enough is enough! Now we're going to fight back!"
"_ds_2053_Frame_1";"Maybe it's a better idea to leave the fighting to those who know what they're doing."
"_ds_2053_Frame_2";"Like who? Will YOU fight for us?"
"_ds_2055_Frame_0";"Let us in. We request an audience with the High Council."
"_ds_2055_Frame_1";"Impossible. The gates stay closed."
"_ds_2055_Frame_2";"Might I ask why?"
"_ds_2055_Frame_3";"Council orders. As long as the pirates are on the loose, none may enter."
"_ds_2055_Frame_4";"Why hasn't anyone done anything about these pirates?"
"_ds_2055_Frame_5";"Funny you should ask. Looking at you the same question just occurred to me. If you're in such a hurry to see the council maybe YOU should do something about the pirates."
"_ds_8040_Frame_0";"I'll give you this: you guys are very reliable. Compared to us, anyways..."
"_ds_8040_Frame_1";"What you sayin', now?"
"_ds_8040_Frame_2";"I'm afraid two wagon loads just aren't enough. I mean, there are more than two prisoners."
"_ds_8040_Frame_3";"Can I kick his head in? Pretty please?"
"_ds_8040_Frame_4";"Personally, I'm in favor of paying."
"_ds_8040_Frame_5";"That might be a better idea."
"_ds_8042_Frame_0";"Nice of you to bring some more supplies, but we're not interested."
"_ds_8042_Frame_1";"Which means?"
"_ds_8042_Frame_2";"The deal is off. And if you don't get out of here right now – well, you'll regret it."
"_ds_8042_Frame_3";"Okay, I'm down for that. It's showtime."
"_ds_4011_Frame_0";"It will be interesting to see how the Gods judge one here."
"_ds_4011_Frame_1";"If this world is anything like our own it probably won't be fun."
"_ds_4011_Frame_2";"We'll see about that."
"_ds_4012_Frame_0";"Is that it?"
"_ds_4012_Frame_1";"That was just round one, my friend."
"_ds_4013_Frame_0";"Which round was that?"
"_ds_4013_Frame_1";"The one right before the really big predators enter the arena."
"_ds_4013_Frame_2";"I guess it's too late to change our minds, right?"
"_ds_4014_Frame_0";"Ready, aim, fire – ready, aim, fire. I'm not a bloody machine."
"_ds_4014_Frame_1";"Would you prefer attack, fall down, get eaten alive?"
"_ds_4016_Frame_0";"Anyone have an idea how long a God needs to make one of these decisions?"
"_ds_4016_Frame_1";"I could probably calculate that - later."
"_ds_4016_Frame_2";"Thanks, but no need."
"_ds_4025_Frame_0";"Gee guys, looks like that our man Livingstone pulled one over on us. 'Cause I don't see no tower nowhere, bro'."
"_ds_4025_Frame_1";"Merely those ruins, and our only chance of escape, I presume, is to build them up again."
"_ds_4025_Frame_2";"There're ship marks down on the beach. Seems like the SEAS were here before us."
"_ds_4025_Frame_3";"Let's hope we get to meet a couple of them. I'd just love to hit them with a few... convincing arguments."
"_ds_4025_Frame_4";"Be that as it may, in any case we have to ensure they cannot reach the tower while it is still being constructed/rebuilt."
"_ds_4026_Frame_0";"No matter where we go – the SEAS always manage to beat us there."
"_ds_4026_Frame_1";"Rather like the Tortoise and the Hare."
"_ds_4026_Frame_2";"No. The SEAS are more of a botanical problem: they're like bad weeds – they pop up everywhere!"
"_ds_4027_Frame_0";"It is good to see you again."
"_ds_4027_Frame_1";"We, too, are happy that we once more walk the same path."
"_ds_4027_Frame_2";"You will have to increase your defences. Heavily armed SEAS ships are already on their way here."
"_ds_4027_Frame_3";"Will you fight them?"
"_ds_4027_Frame_4";"Yo. Bet on that, bro."
"_ds_4027_Frame_5";"Then we shall help."
"_ds_4027_Frame_6";"Good.  First off, you should improve your defenses."
"_ds_4028_Frame_0";"Fate is smilin' on Mama's only boy today. Here come's the backup we need."
"_ds_4028_Frame_1";"It goes without saying that we'd be more than happy to provide any help we can."
"_ds_4029_Frame_0";"From here one has a great view of the sea."
"_ds_4029_Frame_1";"Not only that. If we erect some towers at these locations the SEAS won't be able to get any carriers past without taking some damage."
"_ds_4031_Frame_0";"How do the SEAS always know what we're doing?"
"_ds_4031_Frame_1";"Maybe they're watching us. The question is – where from?"
"_ds_4031_Frame_2";"A group of their leaders lives on an island close to our village."
"_ds_4031_Frame_3";"I think it's time we got to know these officers and gentlemen a little more closely."
"_ds_4032_Frame_0";"Quickly! They are attacking your base. We'll try to delay them as best we can."
"_ds_4033_Frame_0";"Anyone who can count warriors such as yourselves amongst their friends is lucky indeed."
"_ds_4033_Frame_1";"You would have done no less for us. "
"_ds_4034_Frame_0";"Man, this is like tilting against windmills."
"_ds_4034_Frame_1";"Cheer up. Every carrier we can stop from reaching the Holy City is a success in its own right."
"_ds_4036_Frame_0";"If any more carriers get through our defenses, the Holy City is doomed."
"_ds_4036_Frame_1";"Then I guess we'd better make sure that just doesn't happen."
"_ds_4037_Frame_0";"Mission accomplished. The SEAS officers have been eliminated."
"_ds_4037_Frame_1";"That should make things easier."
"_ds_4045_Frame_0";"I think we made it – they seem to be retreating."
"_ds_4046_Frame_0";"I'm afraid they're after our friends."
"_ds_8010_Frame_0";"Damn, we're not getting anywhere here."
"_ds_8010_Frame_1";"We gotta take out those towers."
"_ds_8010_Frame_2";"That will be difficult from the water."
"_ds_8010_Frame_3";"But doable."
"_ds_8010_Frame_4";"What do you two think about finding an overland route instead?"
"_ds_8015_Frame_0";"That looks like the perfect place for our base."
"_ds_8015_Frame_1";"Hopefully we'll have enough time to finish up before the pirates find us."
"_ds_8020_Frame_0";"I want to negotiate."
"_ds_8020_Frame_1";"Very well, then, we're listening."
"_ds_8020_Frame_2";"These slaves are worth a lot to us. But if you send us a load of goods we will release them."
"_ds_8020_Frame_3";"Perhaps we can use this to our advantage. We could hide a spy in the wagon and thus find out just where the pirates are hiding."
"_ds_8030_Frame_0";"We kept our part of the bargain, now it's your turn."
"_ds_8030_Frame_1";"There's just one small thing."
"_ds_8030_Frame_2";"What's that supposed to mean? We had a deal!"
"_ds_8030_Frame_3";"Yes, but we were unaware that one of our prisoners is the Mistress of a Guild. That of course makes her highly valuable. My proposal is this: you send us another load of goods and then we'll let the prisoners go free."
"_ds_8030_Frame_4";"I've got a proposal, too: you give us the prisoners and we won't cool you here and now."
"_ds_8030_Frame_5";"You'll take neither us nor the prisoners alive."
"_ds_8030_Frame_6";"I think that's a strong basis for negotiations."
"_ds_8030_Frame_7";"Me, too."
"_ds_8045_Frame_0";"Oh, so you don't want to negotiate. Okay, then. Once we're done with you we'll grab the prisoners from the fortress and feed them to the fish."
"_ds_2056_Frame_0";"The council's decision is clear: none may enter as long as the pirates are still in the city."
"_ds_3030_Frame_8";"Gee Béla, if I didn't know better, I'd say you've just found another job for me."
"_ds_3030_Frame_9";"Hey, who wants to steal candy from kids every time."
"_ds_3044_Frame_0";"We survived the crash, now all we need to do is find the prophet."
"_ds_3045_Frame_0";"We must hurry. One of their scouts spotted us. If he sounds the alarm, we're finished."
"_ds_3045_Frame_1";"Come on – let's take him out, then."
"_ds_3075_Frame_0";"That fight was a little too easy for my taste."
"_ds_3075_Frame_1";"Don't worry, reinforcements should be here soon."
"_ds_3075_Frame_2";"At the latest when their scouts fail to return."
"_ds_3075_Frame_3";"Yo, mo see how many the SEAS got left."
"_ds_3076_Frame_0";"HALT!"
"_ds_3077_Frame_0";"WHO GOES THERE?!"
"_ds_3078_Frame_0";"STOP!"
"_ds_3079_Frame_0";"ALARM!"
"_ds_3083_Frame_0";"The gate is open. Enjoy your meal. I hope the SEAS don't give you indigestion."
"_ds_3085_Frame_0";"Now the SEAS must know exactly who they're dealing with."
"_ds_3085_Frame_1";"Well we better take out their outposts quickly."
"_ds_3085_Frame_2";"This way we can keep them off our backs, too."
"_ds_3086_Frame_0";"If we want to go through the main gate we're going to need a lot more warriors."
"_ds_3086_Frame_1";"Chill, bro. You ain't never seen me really kick it, yet."
"_ds_3086_Frame_2";"And die. Fortunately we have an alternative. Carnivorous dinosaurs live behind the SEAS base and attack anything that comes near."
"_ds_3086_Frame_3";"You call that an alternative?"
"_ds_3086_Frame_4";"They won't hurt me. I can go past them, open the gate to the base, and let them in."
"_ds_7045_Frame_0";"Up there at the front, on the platform, surely that looks like a differential machine?"
"_ds_7045_Frame_1";"A differential machine?? Ah, you mean a computer. Then that's where we should be."
"_ds_7045_Frame_2";"Don't worry, I'll cover your rear."
"_ds_1081_Frame_0";"I am in your debt, my friends. You have saved the mammoths from extinction. To show you my gratitude, I have taught your people how to train mammoths for battle. You can now build them in your Animal Farm."
"_ds_1082_Frame_0";"I am in your debt. You have saved the holy mammoths from a truly terrible fate. In turn I shall teach you how to use their fighting strength to your own ends."
"_ds_1083_Frame_0";"You failed. Too many of the mammoths died. Now go, and leave me with my pain."
"_ds_1084_Frame_0";"You have done well indeed. My confidence grows like the plants after a summer rain. Let us seek the other mammoths."
"_ds_1091_Frame_0";"You have found a piece of sacred jewelry. A very good omen. It will henceforth bring us luck."
"_ds_1092_Frame_0";"It would seem this wreck has more to offer than we originally thought. We should keep it. The pirates certainly no longer have need of it."
"_ds_1093_Frame_0";"I see the village has firmly taken root and grows strong and true as an oak. Now it is time for you to look after the mammoths. Four mammoth families live upon my island. I fear the Dustriders intend to slay them all."
"_ds_1093_Frame_1";"Perhaps we should build a protective wall around the area before we leave."
"_ds_1094_Frame_0";"We must proceed carefully. First we should concentrate on erecting a fort and training some pikemen. Then we can go hunting for the poachers."
"_ds_1095_Frame_0";"This island has offered many refuge throughout the years, and some of their treasures remain. Watchful eyes may still uncover these treasures in the forests and the fields."
"_ds_1096_Frame_0";"The world itself has brought you to me! I will help you. In the north of the island, between two snow-covered mountains, you will find a smilodon, powerful and dangerous. Bring me one of his teeth and I shall fashion you a powerful talisman."
"_ds_1097_Frame_0";"Excellent. The stars are in your favor and the winds of fortune sing in the trees. I shall prepare your gift."
"_ds_1099_Frame_0";"The mammoths are dying, this I feel."
"_ds_2001_Frame_0";"The poachers are powerful. I don't think your brothers-in-arms can match their numbers and power. Four mammoth families live upon my island. I fear the Dustriders intend to slay them all."
"_ds_2001_Frame_1";"Perhaps we should build a protective wall around the area before we leave."
"_ds_2002_Frame_0";"Yo. That should keep the place safe for awhile."
"_ds_2006_Frame_0";"Ok my friends, I'm going to cruise around a bit. Maybe then I'll be able to give you a couple of tips. Free of charge, naturally."
"_ds_2007_Frame_0";"What luck. I see an uninhabited island that's just loaded with wood."
"_ds_2008_Frame_0";"That looks like one of our family heirlooms down there. My brother must have lost it."
"_ds_2008_Frame_1";"Or he left a trail for us to follow."
"_ds_2008_Frame_2";"Of course! He had two other pieces of jewelry with him. I'll keep my eyes peeled."
"_ds_2011_Frame_0";"Ahhh. You've finally built a second marketplace. As long as no-one takes you for a ride while trading you should be okay for resources."
"_ds_2012_Frame_0";"Here's another piece of that jewelry. Looks like that's the easiest way to the temple. Not bad, brother mine!"
"_ds_2013_Frame_0";"Here! Another heirloom! Hmm, what a beach. The perfect place to relax."
"_ds_2013_Frame_1";"More like a perfect landing spot for our ships."
"_ds_2014_Frame_0";"Yo. Sweet fortress those Amazon babes have built."
"_ds_2014_Frame_1";"I don't think we'll be able to just march through that impressive front door."
"_ds_2014_Frame_2";"Then I guess we should look for the back door, ladies."
"_ds_2015_Frame_0";"I'm not so sure it was such a good idea to force our way in through the the main door."
"_ds_2015_Frame_1";"Look. Are we in, or not?"
"_ds_2016_Frame_0";"Welcome to the lion's den."
"_ds_2016_Frame_1";"Let's hope we can remain undiscovered. At least until we get enough troops here."
"_ds_2017_Frame_0";"That was almost too easy. Now we just open the front door ..."
"_ds_2017_Frame_1";"... and it's time to party."
"_ds_2018_Frame_0";"Man, it's quiet here. Where are we?"
"_ds_2018_Frame_1";"It's called a back door. Obviously the weak point in their defences. However, if that's too simple for you ..."
"_ds_2060_Frame_0";"Isn't that Larry or one of his brothers over there? "
"_ds_2060_Frame_1";"Ah, you must be those helpful heroes my brother told me about. I'm Harry."
"_ds_2060_Frame_2";"Since we're so helpful you probably have a little assignment for us, right?"
"_ds_2060_Frame_3";"Now that you mention it. Larry is waiting for my deliveries down at the harbor, but they seem to keep disappearing into thin air on the way."
"_ds_2060_Frame_4";"Heavy. Is this our problem?"
"_ds_2060_Frame_5";"I understand. If you help me I'll fill your warehouses with food. Is that a deal?"
"_ds_2061_Frame_0";"Yo. Scope this. Black pyjamas, masks and swords. Lemme guess - these gotta be the bad guys."
"_ds_2061_Frame_1";"It's like something one would see in a cheap Kung-Fu movie."
"_ds_2061_Frame_2";"As long as you ignore the fact that those are real swords and their owners are really bloodthirsty..."
"_ds_2062_Frame_0";"My friends, you did a great job. The roads are finally free for free traders."
"_ds_2062_Frame_1";"I don't mean to be rude, but aren't we forgetting something..."
"_ds_2062_Frame_2";"What? Oh, yes – of course. I'll have the food delivered immediately."
"_ds_2063_Frame_0";"One sip from this fountain and you feel like you've been reborn."
"_ds_2063_Frame_1";"Then we'd better remember where they hide these little refreshment stands."
"_ds_2048_Frame_0";"If we get separated we'll meet back here in the tavern."
"_ds_2021_Frame_0";"Help! The animals were scared up and are raging through our base. Please help us to drive them away."
"_ds_2022_Frame_0";"Yo, the dino problem is - under control."
"_ds_2022_Frame_1";"They did do a lot of damage, though."
"_ds_2022_Frame_2";"And they'll be back. They just made this their new hunting grounds."
"_ds_2022_Frame_3";"We'll have to set up camp somewhere else."
"_ds_2022_Frame_4";"We should be safe further to the west. A scout can look for a suitable location."
"_ds_2022_Frame_5";"Good. Let's go get things ready to go."
"_ds_2023_Frame_0";"We found the perfect place. A large plain to the west – we should be safe there for a while."
"_ds_2023_Frame_1";"Good. Let's get these tents down, then."
"_ds_2028_Frame_0";"Oh, man, what's that funky smell? Baby, that's raw."
"_ds_2028_Frame_1";"Those are animal carcasses! I've never seen so many in one place."
"_ds_2028_Frame_2";"Maybe it's a kind of elephant's graveyard for dinosaurs."
"_ds_2028_Frame_3";"No, these animals were poisoned."
"_ds_2028_Frame_4";"Then let's find out who's responsible."
"_ds_2029_Frame_0";"It looks like we've found the source of the problem."
"_ds_2029_Frame_1";"I suspect that the volcanic eruption released something poisonous."
"_ds_2029_Frame_2";"Unusual, but possible."
"_ds_2029_Frame_3";"I'm taking a sample. Who knows what we might learn."
"_ds_2031_Frame_0";"That must be the main Barbarian camp. Just look at them all."
"_ds_2031_Frame_1";"If we can take this camp it will weaken them immensely."
"_ds_2031_Frame_2";"Then we just won't take 'no' for an answer."
"_ds_2058_Frame_0";"Good idea clearing out this area first. Now we can let you have these war engines."
"_ds_2059_Frame_0";"Are you and your animals okay?"
"_ds_2059_Frame_1";"You managed to get here before anything happened to us. May I offer my help in return?"
"_ds_2059_Frame_2";"What kind of help?"
"_ds_2059_Frame_3";"The kind of help a huge, angry meat-eating dinosaur generally provides."
"_ds_8012_Frame_0";"The overland route was worth it. From here we have a perfect field of fire on the pirates."
"_ds_8014_Frame_0";"I'd already given up all hope. Thanks for saving us."
"_ds_8016_Frame_0";"Wassat?"
"_ds_8016_Frame_1";"I'd say it's a fog machine. That could be useful. We should keep it in mind."
"_ds_7011_Frame_0";"We're hardly on the beach and the SEAS are already knocking on the door."
"_ds_7011_Frame_1";"Then why don't you invite our guests in?"
"_ds_7012_Frame_0";"I can't see any weaknesses in their defenses."
"_ds_7012_Frame_1";"Then we'll take 'em apart piece by piece, starting with the bunkers."
"_ds_7013_Frame_0";"And that's the end of Leighton. Wish him well on his way to the hereafter."
"_ds_7013_Frame_1";"Could be a hell of a trip."
"_ds_7013_Frame_2";"Oh, please – he'd run away from the devil himself, too."
"_ds_7014_Frame_0";"Now they're taking us seriously."
"_ds_7014_Frame_1";"We have to take out those guns before they can do any more damage."
"_ds_7015_Frame_0";"I was right. Those were the gun controls."
"_ds_7016_Frame_0";"A heavenly quiet!"
"_ds_7017_Frame_0";"We're running out of time. We have to get into that crater now."
"_ds_7017_Frame_1";"We're on it, bro. But somehow the SEAS just don't want to open the gates and let us in."
"_ds_7027_Frame_0";"He wants to fire it! We have to stop him."
"_ds_7027_Frame_1";"That building must have something to do with it. We gotta get there fast!"
"_ds_0101_Frame_0";"I'm sure you're exhausted from your travels. Why don't you rest up a bit and then explore your surroundings."
"_ds_0103_Frame_0";"We're under attack! To arms!"
"_ds_0103_Frame_1";"I'm afraid your rest will have to wait a bit. Come on!"
"_ds_0107_Frame_0";"I've never seen a cat that big in all my life."
"_ds_0107_Frame_1";"They're attacking the workers! Do something!"
"_ds_0111_Frame_0";"I want a closer look at that cadaver."
"_ds_0111_Frame_1";"First we should check and see just how much damage the attack caused."
"_ds_0111_Frame_2";"Okay, then, we'll join you."
"_ds_0201_Frame_0";"The main building was only lightly damaged. We should be able to repair it ourselves."
"_ds_0201_Frame_1";"Guess I'll go get the tools."
"_ds_0201_Frame_2";"We have people for that. The necessary resources can be found in the immediate area. It would be best if you could keep an eye on the workers."
"_ds_0204_Frame_0";"Why is that taking so long?"
"_ds_0204_Frame_1";"Efficiency is equal to the number of workers times their productivity."
"_ds_0204_Frame_2";"So we need more workers? Why didn't you say that in the first place?"
"_ds_0207_Frame_0";"Our stone supplies are sinking much too quickly. We require more resources."
"_ds_0207_Frame_1";"We should split up and look fore more resources."
"_ds_0209_Frame_0";"So there are a few stones left here."
"_ds_0209_Frame_1";"I'll send over a couple of workers."
"_ds_0212_Frame_0";"Excellent! We now have enough resources to repair all of the damaged buildings."
"_ds_0212_Frame_1";"Then I'll look after the practical end of things."
"_ds_0216_Frame_0";"I'm quite recovered and fit as a fiddle. Shall we continue?"
"_ds_0301_Frame_0";"Man, I'm all in."
"_ds_0301_Frame_1";"I never knew science could be so physically challenging."
"_ds_0301_Frame_2";"Unfortunately your training is not yet complete. You should delegate more of the work. Get yourself some more people to help you."
"_ds_0313_Frame_0";"No matter how many of these cats we kill, more just keep coming."
"_ds_0313_Frame_1";"There must be a den close by where they raise their young."
"_ds_0313_Frame_2";"Come on, let's take it out."
"_ds_0317_Frame_0";"The tracks lead directly towards that little hill."
"_ds_0317_Frame_1";"Keep those weapons handy, people."
"_ds_0323_Frame_0";"So, all that's left to do is hang the trophies over the fireplace."
"_ds_0323_Frame_1";"Congratulations. That calls for a celebration. Which of you is best at skinning and cleaning?"
"_ds_0401_Frame_0";"Why don't we use these animals ourselves?"
"_ds_0401_Frame_1";"You want to breed lap tigers? Isn't that a little on the dangerous side?"
"_ds_0401_Frame_2";"I thought you loved danger. I think Stina's idea is splendid."
"_ds_0410_Frame_0";"He's gone. Just disappeared."
"_ds_0410_Frame_1";"Well, I'm sure he'll come again. We'll get him then."
"_ds_0410_Frame_2";"Only if we're faster than we were today."
"_ds_0412_Frame_0";"It seems we've found our thief. A scout reports having seen the missing items on a neighboring island."
"_ds_0412_Frame_1";"Time to get them back – and to have a little talk with the bad guys."
"_ds_0412_Frame_2";"We should take our troops with us. Who knows what might await us on that island."
"_ds_0417_Frame_0";"Congratulations! You've completed all your assignments."
"_ds_0417_Frame_1";"Then we can finally get started?"
"_ds_0417_Frame_2";"Naturally. But first, I have a few preparations to complete. Rest a bit in the meanwhile – you've really earned it."
"_ds_2054_Frame_0";"Thank you for your heroic efforts. Finally someone is doing something about those guys."
"_ds_2054_Frame_1";"Can we count on your help?"
"_ds_2054_Frame_2";"Of course. We'll fight to the last man."
"_ds_4070_Frame_0";"It's time. Our outposts are already under attack. Now it's up to us. We have to hold the gate at all costs."
"_ds_4070_Frame_1";"Alright, people. Time to push the SEAS and their machines back to the ocean."
"_ds_4070_Frame_2";"They're guaranteed to use the old pilgrimage route."
"_ds_4070_Frame_3";"Then we'll just have to make the trip a little tougher than the others. Let's harden that route."
"_ds_4071_Frame_0";"I was beginnin' to think it would never end."
"_ds_4071_Frame_1";"It never will, either. They'll keep attacking us as long as they have one base intact."
"_ds_4072_Frame_0";"The Norsemen are coming to help us. Together we'll be able to annihilate the SEAS."
"_ds_4072_Frame_1";"Let's get 'em!"
"_ds_4073_Frame_0";"Finally. Here come the Dustriders with reinforcements."
"_ds_4073_Frame_1";"Now that's what I'D call in the nick of time."
"_ds_4073_Frame_2";"Better late than never. Now for the counter-attack."
"_ds_4074_Frame_0";"Run, bastards, run!"
"_ds_4074_Frame_1";"We really did it! We have beaten the SEAS!"
"_ds_4074_Frame_2";"Don't halloo till you're out of the wood!"
"_ds_4074_Frame_3";"We can not allow them to attack the city again!"
"_ds_4075_Frame_0";"Hey, down there. Can you hear me?"
"_ds_4075_Frame_1";"Terribly sorry. I'm afraid it's really incovenient right now. I have to win this little war, first. You know how it is."
"_ds_4075_Frame_2";"How about a few RESOURCES, then?"
"_ds_4075_Frame_3";"Excellent."
"_ds_4075_Frame_4";"Okay, then clear me a landing spot down there."
"_ds_4075_Frame_5";"That could take a bit! We're drawing heavy fire."
"_ds_4075_Frame_6";"Don't take too long. Once the SEAS get ranged in on my zeppelin it'll all be too late."
"_ds_4076_Frame_0";"I don't want to seem ungrateful, or anything, but the air up here is starting to show an extremely high concentration of lead."
"_ds_4076_Frame_1";"We're doing our best. It'll just be a moment."
"_ds_4077_Frame_0";"We weren't fast enough. The SEAS have sent fresh reinforcements to that outpost in the west."
"_ds_4077_Frame_1";"Then we'll have to train more troops to take them out."
"_ds_4078_Frame_0";"Good work. I'll just unload these resources, then."
"_ds_4078_Frame_1";"Shouldn't we discuss the price?"
"_ds_4078_Frame_2";"After all you've done for my brothers and me the first load is on the house."
"_ds_4078_Frame_3";"I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
"_ds_4079_Frame_0";"Sorry, friends, but things are getting a little too hot for me. I've gotta go."
"_ds_4079_Frame_1";"There goes our best hope for re-supply."
"_ds_4083_Frame_0";"Sometimes I truly hate being right."
"_ds_4083_Frame_1";"Chin up. If we can stop the SEAS here and now, we'll have the worst of it behind us."
"_ds_4084_Frame_0";"Good fight. Thanks, my friends."
"_ds_4084_Frame_1";"It is good to once again fight side-by-side with you."
"_ds_4085_Frame_0";"Looks like things are cool here."
"_ds_4085_Frame_1";"Which makes me a little uneasy."
"_ds_4085_Frame_2";"You thinkin' what I'm thinkin', bro'?"
"_ds_4085_Frame_3";"Unless I'm terribly mistaken I think we had better prepare for a large-scale attack."
"_ds_4086_Frame_0";"Where are the SEAS gettin' all their resources?"
"_ds_4086_Frame_1";"There must be a warehouse somewhere. Life would be a great deal easier if we could find it."
"_ds_4086_Frame_2";"True that, bro. Your plan."
"_ds_4087_Frame_0";"There go the SEAS supplies up in smoke."
"_ds_4087_Frame_1";"I have never seen a cheerier bonfire."
"_ds_4088_Frame_0";"We could make our lives much easier by taking out their outposts."
"_ds_4088_Frame_1";"Do you have a plan?"
"_ds_4088_Frame_2";"Our scouts have located a poorly protected outpost to the east."
"_ds_4088_Frame_3";"Béla, the sun rises in the east and sets in the west! Lets grab some troops and erase the outpost in the... West!"
"_ds_4089_Frame_0";"We can't hold the outposts against the numbers the SEAS are throwin' at us."
"_ds_4089_Frame_1";"Quick! We have to gather our troops and counter-attack before they build a base on our doorstep."
"_ds_4090_Frame_0";"Excellent, the area is ours once more."
"_ds_4090_Frame_1";"I'll look after the defenses. That ain't gonna happen twice, bro."
"_ds_4092_Frame_0";"Looks like they've dug themselves in everywhere, cuz."
"_ds_4092_Frame_1";"Then I guess we should scout out their bases and take them out."
"_ds_4093_Frame_0";"That's that. We've taken out all of their outposts. Time to kick back and chill a bit."
"_ds_4094_Frame_0";"Yo, where the hell are they coming from now?"
"_ds_4094_Frame_1";"The beach. I think the SEAS are using ships to transport their troops here."
"_ds_4094_Frame_2";"Then we should either take out their ships, or better yet, the SEAS harbor."
"_ds_4095_Frame_0";"Without their transport ships they cannot attack from the water anymore."
"_ds_4095_Frame_1";"Which gives us as much time as we need to prepare for the grand finale."
"_ds_4096_Frame_0";"James? Where are you going?"
"_ds_4096_Frame_1";"I'm going to put a few nests in the SEAS' path. The dilophosaurs should prove a tremendous obstacle when they hatch."
"_ds_4096_Frame_2";"Be careful!"
"_ds_4097_Frame_0";"I'm sure my pets will surprise the SEAS no end."
"_ds_6100_Frame_0";"CODE RED – I repeat: CODE RED. Our base is under attack. All units are to report immediately to your posts."
"_ds_6101_Frame_0";"Pretty impressive defenses the SEAS have there."
"_ds_6101_Frame_1";"We should proceed systematically. First we destroy the outlying defenses and bunkers and then we take out the main complex."
"_ds_6102_Frame_0";"They really must learn that you can't just run from your problems."
"_ds_6102_Frame_1";"Maybe we should concentrate on the prison and leave the group therapy for later."
"_ds_6103_Frame_0";"For a Victorian old boy's club, our adversaries have some impressive weaponry at their command."
"_ds_6103_Frame_1";"We're gonna have to take out these machineguns."
"_ds_6104_Frame_0";"Bunkers, just great. You guys ever see 'Saving Private Ryan'?"
"_ds_6104_Frame_1";"Yes, but they didn't have dinosaurs. We must take out those emplacements one way or another."
"_ds_6107_Frame_0";"Excellent, that should help our attack considerably."
"_ds_6108_Frame_0";"We found their headquarters."
"_ds_6108_Frame_1";"And therefore Leighton, too, most probably."
"_ds_6108_Frame_2";"That would explain the overkill on the defenses."
"_ds_6108_Frame_3";"Let's destroy the outlying defenses first before moving on to the headquarters."
"_ds_6109_Frame_0";"That puts a definite crimp on their striking power."
"_ds_6109_Frame_1";"Then it's time to drag our friend Leighton outta there."
"_ds_L01B01_Frame_0";"You've washed up on the shore of an uncharted island. Explore the area and try to find Stina and Béla."
"_ds_L01B02_Frame_0";"You have a new assignment to complete. Check your Quest log for more information on your new assignment."
"_ds_L01B03_Frame_0";"You now have enough Skulls to promote Cole to the next level. This gives him powerful new skills. Promoted units are automatically completely healed and receive improved combat values. You can find more details in the Online help (F1)."
"_ds_L01B04_Frame_0";"The Warriors have agreed to join you. They will help you find Stina and Béla if you help them against their enemies."
"_ds_L01B05_Frame_0";"Careful! If you attack friendly units they will soon turn hostile! This will prevent you from completing your current quest!"
"_ds_L01B06_Frame_0";"Spearmen are particularly effective at fighting animals."
"_ds_L01B07_Frame_0";"At level 2 Stina receives a new skill which gives spearmen in her vicinity an armor bonus."
"_ds_L01B08_Frame_0";"Béla is on his own, as Cole and Stina are unable to open or destroy the gate. Try to free the other prisoners. Avoid direct contact with the enemy, at least until you have some of the troops under your command."
"_ds_L01B09_Frame_0";"Béla's level 2 skills are extremely helpful. They enable all archers in his vicinity to shoot 10 m further. This lets them take out the guards from a safe distance."
"_ds_L01B10_Frame_0";"You should look for the main Barbarian base. It must be close by."
"_ds_L01B11_Frame_0";"Gates can represent a weak point during combat and should be protected accordingly – by bunkers, for example. The gate is closed at the moment. To open it you have to switch it to either "Automatic" or "Open". However, "Open" means that enemy units can also enter through the gate."
"_ds_L01B12_Frame_0";"The engineer can now make rams. These are very effective against walls, buildings and towers."
"_ds_L01B13_Frame_0";"Bases can have more than one entrance. If the main gate is protected by towers, as is the case here, then it is a good idea to look for a back gate."
"_ds_L01B14_Frame_0";"You should build a tavern now. Heroes who have fallen in battle can be re-hired there."
"_ds_L01B15_Frame_0";"The gates are closed at the moment. Before you can explore the rest of the island you will have to set the gates to "Open" or "Automatic"."
"_ds_L01B16_Frame_0";"There are still a number of enemy units in the area. You will have to take them out before the workers will join you."
"_ds_L01B17_Frame_0";"Building repairs also require resources. Since your supplies are too low to repair all of your buildings you will have to arrange for more resources before proceeding."
"_ds_L01B18_Frame_0";"Some buildings can be placed close to the source of the resource being harvested, shortening the distance your workers have to travel.  These buildings also increase the storage capacity for the resource harvested."
"_ds_L01B19_Frame_0";"You should start building up a powerful army. At the same time you should continue to explore the island. You should also be prepared for enemy attack."
"_ds_L01B20_Frame_0";"The color of the ghost image indicates whether or not a building can be built on a particular site. If the image is green the building site can be used. If it turns red you have to either find another site or rotate the building. Plants, brush or ruins have no effect on construction as they are automatically removed."
"_ds_L01B21_Frame_0";"A fishing boat lets you catch fish as an additional source of food supply. In order to this you have to send the fishing boat to a spot in the ocean where there is a swarm of fish."
"_ds_L01B22_Frame_0";"When a hero reaches level 3 they receive a new special skill which can be performed using the action menu."
"_ds_L01B23_Frame_0";"From level 3 onwards Béla can take a Sniper-Shot which causes immense damage to a single enemy. To use this skill, click the appropriate symbol in Béla's action menu and then left-click the target."
"_ds_L01B24_Frame_0";"From level 3 onwards Stina can hypnotize animals and mounted units. To use this skill, click the appropriate symbol in Stina's action menu and then left-click an enemy unit. The unit then lies down for a short period of time and remains lying down even if attacked."
"_ds_L01B25_Frame_0";"From level 3 onwards Cole can use his shotgun, causing a great deal of damage to all enemies within range. To take a shot, click the appropriate symbol in Cole's action menu and then left-click the enemy unit you want to use as the main target."
"_ds_L01B26_Frame_0";"Your hero has fallen in combat. As long as you have access to a tavern you can re-hire him at any time for a certain amount of resources."
"_ds_L01B27_Frame_0";"You should go to the tavern and re-hire Cole so that he can help you fight the Barbarians."
"_ds_L02B01_Frame_0";"Make sure you have enough room for a gate when planning a wall. Don't forget that your walls have to be defended."
"_ds_L02B02_Frame_0";"You could use this space to produce units. That way they don't have as far to go to the batttle."
"_ds_L02B03_Frame_0";"Rams are especially effective againts towers and walls, but they don't stand much of a chance against infantry."
"_ds_L02B04_Frame_0";"Transport ships offer a fast, practical way to transport large numbers of troops. However, they do require a harbor."
"_ds_L02B05_Frame_0";"This area is dangerous, so you shouldn't leave your base unprotected for very long."
"_ds_L02B06_Frame_0";"You can now enter Epoch 4. If you have enough resources you can start to do the necessary research."
"_ds_L02B07_Frame_0";"The Dustriders have a mobile floating harbor they can hide a ways away from their base."
"_ds_L02B08_Frame_0";"Promoting Cole to level 4 lets the weapon smith develop a new unit: the Berserker. Berserkers are powerful fighters, but they become impossible to control once they run into an enemy unit."
"_ds_L02B09_Frame_0";"Promoting Stina to level 4 lets the animal farm train a new unit: the Eusmilus Rider. This fast, powerful unit is equally effective against infantry, animals and vehicles alike."
"_ds_L02B10_Frame_0";"Now that Béla has reached level 4 you can have the weapon smith train crossbowmen. These are better equipped and do a lot more damage than archers."
"_ds_L03B01_Frame_0";"You should build some walls to better defend against attack."
"_ds_L03B02_Frame_0";"Enemies don't always attack from their main base. Sometimes they also establish outposts. Whenever you defeat one of these advance bases you gain the land it was on for your own base."
"_ds_L03B03_Frame_0";"It's worth taking the time to explore the entire map and carefully scout the terrain. There are a number of islands here, all of which have their advantages and disadvantages."
"_ds_L03B03b_Frame_0";"The western island is rich in resources but difficult to defend; the eastern island would be a good place to base an attack from but is defended by ships. The northern island offers both resources and a land route to the temple."
"_ds_L03B04_Frame_0";"The Log Cannon lets you attack walls and towers from a safe distance.  However, Log Cannons are defenseless against infantry units."
"_ds_L04B01_Frame_0";"The Dustriders have a mobile camp which also increases their unit limit. Just like the Norsemen, this is also where new Epochs are developed. The Dustriders are the only tribe to require Skulls to enter a new Epoch."
"_ds_L04B02_Frame_0";"The Dustriders are a very mobile, flexible nomadic tribe. They can take down their buildings quickly, recovering the resources used to build them in the process."
"_ds_L04B03_Frame_0";"Thanks to its natural armor, the Ankylosaurus well protected against enemy fire and can use its powerful tail to destroy enemy fortifications."
"_ds_L04B04_Frame_0";"You have just gained access to a new military unit. From now on your medium dino farms can produce Ankylosaurus units, including one equipped with a catapult."
"_ds_L04B05_Frame_0";"You should explore your surroundings thoroughly."
"_ds_L04B06_Frame_0";"You should always keep an eye out for special items on your travels."
"_ds_L04B07_Frame_0";"Dustrider Temples let you train Shamans. While Shamans can't heal injured units, they can resurrect any who die."
"_ds_L04B08_Frame_0";"If necessary, Dustrider infantry units can erect buildings just like a worker."
"_ds_L04B09_Frame_0";"New units enter this world throught the portal. You should attack it to prevent the enemy troops from receiving reinforcements."
"_ds_L04B10_Frame_0";"You need a medium dino farm in order to train more powerful dinosaurs. You can either build an entirely new one or upgrade a small dino farm. You can find the appropriate button in the building menu."
"_ds_L04B11_Frame_0";"Well done! That was the first outpost."
"_ds_L04B12_Frame_0";"Good work. You destroyed both outposts."
"_ds_L04B13_Frame_0";"Your units suffer damage when they come into contact with a poison lake."
"_ds_L05B01_Frame_0";"Excellent! This base is once more in the hands of the city guards."
"_ds_L05B02_Frame_0";"Excellent. You have recaptured this quarter too."
"_ds_L05B03_Frame_0";"Congratulations! You've retaken this area."
"_ds_L05B04_Frame_0";"This city has a tavern which you can use just like you would your own."
"_ds_L05B05_Frame_0";"You can use these wells to heal your units. Be careful, though, for these wells are not bottomless. Once a well has been emptied it will take a while for it to refill."
"_ds_L05B06_Frame_0";"The pirates have recaptured a base. You will have to drive them off again."
"_ds_L06B01_Frame_0";"I'm afraid I'm not allowed to tell you anything about this barrier!"
"_ds_L06B02_Frame_0";"Smoke towers hide all of their owners buildings within a certain radius."
"_ds_L06B03_Frame_0";"Mines explode as soon as someone approaches within 10 m of them and do enormous amounts of damage."
"_ds_L06B04_Frame_0";"Traps are normally invisible until triggered. However, Shamans can use their "Reveal" ability to reveal traps or camouflaged units."
"_ds_L06B05_Frame_0";"Barrel-throwing giant apes aren't actually regular units in this game."
"_ds_L06B06_Frame_0";"You can also set up another camp on the pirates' island to help supply your army."
"_ds_L06B07_Frame_0";"You may now build a harbor. This is more important than it sounds, for this harbor is not just another building. The Dustrider harbor is mobile and can even be used for fishing. However, it also takes up a slot in your army controller."
"_ds_L06B08_Frame_0";"If you sail the harbor to a school of fish it will automatically begin to harvest them. The rally point for units produced by the harbor remains unchanged, no matter where you move the harbor. However, you can always change the rally point manually."
"_ds_L06B09_Frame_0";"The Catamaran the Dustriders can build from Epoch 4 onwards can destroy buildings from the water. "
"_ds_L06B10_Frame_0";"The Brachiosaurus is a powerful and extremely flexible unit. Depending upon how it is equipped it can either provide close-combat support or, when equipped with a catapult, be used against buildings and fortifications. You can even re-equip the unit during combat."
"_ds_L07B01_Frame_0";"In some situations it's better to retreat than to continue to fight a hopeless battle."
"_ds_L07B02_Frame_0";"If you promote Taslow to level 4 you can build Taslow Towers."
"_ds_L07B03_Frame_0";"You should build up a powerful army before marching off to battle."
"_ds_L07B04_Frame_0";"In order to complete the mission Stina, Béla, Cole and Taslow all have to reach one of the question marks found in the temple together."
"_ds_L07B05_Frame_0";"You now have a fishing harbor."
"_ds_L07B06_Frame_0";"You should use your harbor to build ships. Some places are only reachable by water."
"_ds_L07B07_Frame_0";"You may be able to avoid particularly difficult battles by trying to find an alternate route. Sometimes it can also be useful to spy out a target from the water."
"_ds_L07B08_Frame_0";"If your opponents manage to reach Taslow's house you will lose this level."
"_ds_L07B09_Frame_0";"Expect your attackers to come at you from more than one direction. It would be a good idea to try and find your enemies as quickly as possible."
"_ds_L07B10_Frame_0";"The Water Temple city to the north will ignore you unless you approach their military camp too closely. That's something you can take advantage of."
"_ds_L07B11_Frame_0";"If you are using the minimap to guide your army you should make sure you don't accidentally run into any enemy units."
"_ds_L07B12_Frame_0";"The shortest route to the Temple follows the streambed north before heading northwest into the desert through the enemy army camp. From there you can cross the Savannah to the northeast to end up at the gates to the Water Temple city."
"_ds_L07B13_Frame_0";"The attack on the army camp has alarmed your enemies, who will now also be patrolling the shoreline."
"_ds_L09B01_Frame_0";"You have reached the Jungle. Your mission is to find the Prophet and carry out the task the Holy City council has given you."
"_ds_L09B02_Frame_0";"The Dragon Clan has to build more town centers in order to increase the unit limit."
"_ds_L09B03_Frame_0";"With the exception of towers, walls, and traps, all Dragon Clan buildings can be fitted with explosive charges. When destroyed by an attacker, they explode, damaging any units in the area."
"_ds_L09B04_Frame_0";"Not only can the Scorpion harvest wood, it is also a powerful close-combat unit."
"_ds_L09B05_Frame_0";"The Baryonyx is an amphibian, and can therefore be used both on land and in the water."
"_ds_L09B06_Frame_0";"The Dragon Clan are experts at using traps to protect themselves. These traps are invisible to the enemy until either revealed using a special ability or set off."
"_ds_L09B07_Frame_0";"The Muraenosaurus is a marine unit capable of sneaking up on an enemy without being seen."
"_ds_L09B08_Frame_0";"Well done. You've found one of the aircraft parts."
"_ds_L09B09_Frame_0";"This is a perfect spot from which to explore the island more thoroughly."
"_ds_L09B10_Frame_0";"You absolutely have to hold this position. Otherwise you will lose this level."
"_ds_L10B01_Frame_0";"Wild animals won't attack James Warden. Once he reaches level 2 this ability also applies to allied units close to him."
"_ds_L10B02_Frame_0";"Your infantry units are now able to dig trenches. Units hiding in trenches are normally invisible to the enemy, but can be revealed using a special ability."
"_ds_L10B03_Frame_0";"You will encounter SEAS units in the surrounding jungle. If a SEAS unit sees you they will attempt to warn their base. Any attack made on an SEAS base will set off an alarm and warn all enemy units. The SEAS will not attack unless the alarm has been raised."
"_ds_L10B04_Frame_0";"Dragon Clan walls damage enemy units when attacked."
"_ds_L10B05_Frame_0";"Smoke bombers hide all friendly units in the area except for themselves and other smoke bombers. Hidden units cannot be attacked and remain hidden even when they themselves are attacking."
"_ds_L10B06_Frame_0";"Smoke towers hide all friendly buildings in the area except for themselves and other smoke towers. Hidden buildings cannot be attacked and remain hidden even when they themselves are attacking."
"_ds_L10B07_Frame_0";"Ninjas are close combat specialists who can also open locked gates. They can sneak into enemy bases and eliminate workers and other enemies not visible to their own units."
"_ds_L12B01_Frame_0";"You must repair the tower before the SEAS can destroy it. Otherwise you will lose this level."
"_ds_L12B02_Frame_0";"The SEAS have almost destroyed the tower."
"_ds_L13B01_Frame_0";"The first thing you should do is destroy the nearby SEAS base ."
"_ds_L13B02_Frame_0";"This is an excellent construction site."
"_ds_L13B03_Frame_0";"You should probably look for a better route."
"_ds_L13B04_Frame_0";"Warning! The city walls are under attack!"
"_ds_L13B05_Frame_0";"Warning! The gate to the city is under attack!"
"_ds_L13B06_Frame_0";"If you are starting to run low on resources you should see about finding new sources before it is too late."
"_ds_L13B08_Frame_0";"It might be a good idea to secure all approaches to the base – even if there doesn't appear to be any threat from this direction."
"_ds_L13B09_Frame_0";"One way to hold off an enemy is to use traps. At least, if you have the right resources."
"_ds_L13B10_Frame_0";"The SEAS are planning a massive attack in the forseeable future. Prepare yourself accordingly."
"_ds_L13B11_Frame_0";"The SEAS' main attack could take place any minute. Make sure your walls are adequately defended!"
"_ds_L13B12_Frame_0";"You still have a short breather before the main attack begins."
"_ds_L13B13_Frame_0";"Once James Warden reaches level 4 you can build Dilophosaurus nests."
"_ds_L13B14_Frame_0";"You must build 8 working nests close to the city walls in order to complete the assignment."
"_ds_L13B15_Frame_0";"If you place the nests close to one another the Dilophosaurs can take down even powerful enemies."
"_ds_L13B16_Frame_0";"If you can find the SEAS supply base and destroy it you can cut off the flow of supplies to the main SEAS base, preventing them from producing more troops ."
"_ds_L13B17_Frame_0";"Excellent. The SEAS' supplies have been cut off."
"_ds_L14B01_Frame_0";"You should destroy this prison so you can use the land for a construction site."
"_ds_L14B02_Frame_0";"If you don't find any resources the first time around it might be a good idea to keep looking – maybe on one of the other islands."
"_ds_L14B03_Frame_0";"The prisoners you released will help you attack the SEAS base. They are gathering close to the main gate. You can pick them up there when you are ready to attack the base."
"_ds_L14B04_Frame_0";"If you approach the prisoners too closely they will interpret that as the signal to attack the SEAS base. Stay away from them until you are ready to attack."
"_ds_L15B01_Frame_0";"5 pump stations supply the energy for the volcanic jet. All 5 of these stations will have to be shut down to prevent ignition. To do this you will have to first take out all enemy units in the area and then station your own troops at the pumps. Be careful, though – the SEAS can also re-take these pumps."
"_ds_L15B02_Frame_0";"Excellent. You've captured a pump station."
"_ds_L15B03_Frame_0";"You've lost a pump station to the SEAS."
"_ds_L16B01_Frame_0";"Babbit has to start up the Scorpion first. Until he does you can ignore him and concentrate on taking out the SEAS troops."
"_ds_L16B02_Frame_0";"There is a medicinal well close by which you can use to heal wounded heroes. But remember – the well isn't bottomless!"
"_ds_L16B03_Frame_0";"You will have to distract that monstrosity and attack its legs to prevent Taslow from being attacked!"
"_ds_L16B04_Frame_0";"You will have to draw the sting down before you can attack it. Be careful not to get hit in the process. Stina's speed and agility make her perfect for the job."
"_ds_L16B05_Frame_0";"Babbit will try to kill Taslow. If he succeeds you will lose the level."
"_ds_L16B06_Frame_0";"You can't attack the Scorpion directly. You will have to destroy the control stations instead and disable it that way!"
"_ds_L16B07_Frame_0";"Congratulations, there go the claws!"
"_ds_L16B08_Frame_0";"Well done! You're almost there."
"_ds_L00B01_Frame_0";"Welcome to Viking Park! This tutorial will teach you the basics about the game's controls."
"_ds_L00B02_Frame_0";"You can use the arrow keys to change the camera position."
"_ds_L00B03_Frame_0";"Rolling the mouse wheel forwards will zoom in on the action and give you a close-up view of your units. To zoom out and get a quick overview of the situation, just roll your mouse wheel backwards."
"_ds_L00B04_Frame_0";"You can also change the camera position by pressing and holding the ALT key, right-clicking a point in the landscape and then pulling it towards you."
"_ds_L00B05_Frame_0";"Great."
"_ds_L00B06_Frame_0";"Well done."
"_ds_L00B07_Frame_0";"Excellent."
"_ds_L00B08_Frame_0";"Wonderful."
"_ds_L00B09_Frame_0";"Exactly."
"_ds_L00B10_Frame_0";"That's working great."
"_ds_L00B11_Frame_0";"Question marks point out places which are important for the completion of an assignment. Move the mouse pointer over the question mark – a tool tip appears explaining exactly what you have to do here. Assignments are automatically added to the quest log displayed in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. The quest log starts to blink whenever you get or complete an assignment or when an assignment changes."
"_ds_L00B12_Frame_0";"You can select units by either left-clicking them or drawing a selection box around them while holding the left mouse button down. You can also select units by left-clicking them in the army controller. If you want to add another unit to a group already selected just hold the CTRL or SHIFT key down while left-clicking the unit to be added. Orders are given using the right mouse button. For example, if you want to send one or more units to a particular place you just select the appropriate units and right-click the place you want them to go."
"_ds_L00B13_Frame_0";"Just give it another try! Select the units using a left-click or a selection box and then send them on their way with a right-click."
"_ds_L00B14_Frame_0";"Fights and other important events are indicated by pulsating colored circles on the  mini-map. This way you can see where something is happening right away. A left-click on the mini-map immediately positions the camera at the chosen location."
"_ds_L00B15_Frame_0";"When a unit comes within sight of an enemy, a yellow exclamation mark appears above its head. If you pull the unit back fast enough, the enemy will lose interest, otherwise they will attack. Units attacked automatically defend themselves. If you want to attack an enemy, select one or more combat units and right-click the enemy unit you want to attack."
"_ds_L00B16_Frame_0";"When you defeat an enemy you receive a special resource: its skull. The more powerful the enemy unit is, the more skulls you receive. You can use them to promote units to higher levels. The higher the level to which you want to promote the unit, the more skulls it will cost."
"_ds_L00B17_Frame_0";"A number of workers have joined you. They can harvest resources – by harvesting berries, for example. Food is required to produce new units or to do research. Select your workers and use a right-click to send them out to get berries."
"_ds_L00B18_Frame_0";"Your people are in urgent need of food. Make sure you always have enough resources."
"_ds_L00B19_Frame_0";"If you need more workers you can produce them in the town center. Select the town center and tell it to produce 3 workers."
"_ds_L00B20_Frame_0";"You need more workers."
"_ds_L00B21_Frame_0";"Resources can be found anywhere on the map. Stones and food sources are represented by white squares on the mini-map. Forests – used for wood – are shown in green."
"_ds_L00B22_Frame_0";"You can build stone quarries and forester's lodges close to where resources are harvested to shorten the distance your workers have to travel. The workers will then bring the resources there instead of to the town center. These buildings also increase storage capacity. Once the available storage space has been used up, no further resources of that type can be harvested."
"_ds_L00B23_Frame_0";"You haven't collected enough resources yet!"
"_ds_L00B24_Frame_0";"Workers can repair damaged buildings. This also uses resources. Select a worker and then right-click a damaged building to repair it."
"_ds_L00B25_Frame_0";"You haven't repaired all the buildings yet!"
"_ds_L00B26_Frame_0";"You're up against dangerous animals again. If you don't stop the wild cats quickly enough they will kill all your workers, who are poor fighters."
"_ds_L00B27_Frame_0";"Before we can produce better combat units we will first have to expand our settlement so that we can do the necessary research."
"_ds_L00B28_Frame_0";"Cottages raise the unit limit. No further units can be produced once the limit has been reached."
"_ds_L00B29_Frame_0";"You need more housing! Otherwise you won't be able to build any more units!"
"_ds_L00B30_Frame_0";"You can rotate buildings before placing them. Select a worker and choose a building from his construction menu. Now hold the shift button (Shift). Now you can use the mouse to rotate the building. When you release the button the building will remain in the last location chosen. You won't be able to see whether or not you can actually place the building there until you release the shift key. Rotating a building can shorten travel distances and can sometimes allow buildings to be placed in spots where the normal orientation wouldn't allow."
"_ds_L00B31_Frame_0";"You will have to develop Epoch 2 before you can research new buildings and more powerful units. Select the town center and then click the Epoch 2 button."
"_ds_L00B32_Frame_0";"You have to develop Epoch 2!"
"_ds_L00B33_Frame_0";"Infantry units are produced by the barracks. In the course of the game you will also get to erect buildings capable of producing other combat units, but for now a barracks is enough!"
"_ds_L00B34_Frame_0";"Build a barrack!"
"_ds_L00B35_Frame_0";"Each unit is particularly effective in combat against a specific type of enemy. For example, spearmen are particularly effective in fighting animals or mounted units. Now produce four spearmen!"
"_ds_L00B36_Frame_0";"Your hunting group isn't big enough!"
"_ds_L00B37_Frame_0";"All selectable objects have their own tool tips. These are displayed above the mini-map on the right whenever the mouse points to that object. Everything worth knowing about the object is shown there in point form. If you select the object, detailed information on it will be displayed in the info window at the lower left e.g. its exact combat values."
"_ds_L00B38_Frame_0";"The Army Controller on the left-hand side of the screen gives you a fast overview of all of your units. You can open or close the army controller using either the Tab key or by clicking the Epoch bar. When it is open you see all your units and when closed only those units which are fighting or have nothing to do. Units or groups of units can be selected in the army controller by left-clicking them or drawing a selection box around them."
"_ds_L00B39_Frame_0";"Food can be found not only on land. Fishing boats allow you to harvest fishing grounds. The fishing boat delivers the catch to the harbor."
"_ds_L00B40_Frame_0";"Find the nest! Otherwise the settlement is in danger!"
"_ds_L00B41_Frame_0";"Animals all react differently: there are aggressive animals which automatically attack anything in their area and peaceful animals which run away instead. Neutral animals don't attack on their own but will defend themselves if attacked. Most animals live in herds and help each other in case of emergency. Young animals are produced in nests. These nests must be destroyed to prevent more animals from being produced."
"_ds_L00B42_Frame_0";"All of the smilodons have to be destroyed together with their nest!"
"_ds_L00B43_Frame_0";"As mentioned, each unit is particularly effective against a specific type of enemy. Conversely they are also particularly vulnerable to other units. While Spearmen are particularly effective against animals or mounted units, they are much less effective against infantry, vehicles and buildings. You can select all units of a certain type simply by double-clicking a single unit."
"_ds_L00B44_Frame_0";"You can promote units if you have enough skulls. To do so, just click the corresponding button in the action menu. You can also promote a unit using the army controller by clicking the unit and dragging it up to the next level with the mouse button held down. Heroes receive special abilities when promoted."
"_ds_L00B45_Frame_0";"Promote a unit to level 2!"
"_ds_L00B46_Frame_0";"Animal carcasses can also provide food. Send a couple of workers to a dead animal. Workers can also hunt, but don't forget that they are poor fighters and don't stand a chance against real predators. Pay particular attention to the distance the workers have to travel as the carcasses rot after a while."
"_ds_L00B47_Frame_0";"Lead the heroes to Ada!"
"_ds_L00B48_Frame_0";"Animal combat units are produced on animal farms. These come in different levels and sizes. Megaloceros – giant deer – are light scouting units, for example. Large animals such as mammoths, woolly rhinos or even triceratopses can be produced in later Epochs."
"_ds_L00B49_Frame_0";"Build an animal farm!"
"_ds_L00B50_Frame_0";"Some units such as chariots or rhino transporters can load and carry additional infantry units. These are particularly well protected in the transporter. A chariot is also much faster than an infantry unit."
"_ds_L00B51_Frame_0";"Build a chariot!"
"_ds_L00B52_Frame_0";"Any ranged fighters riding in a chariot or rhino transporter can fire out at enemies."
"_ds_L00B53_Frame_0";"Produce an archer and load him onto the chariot!"
"_ds_L00B54_Frame_0";"The symbols in the army controller indicate just what a given unit is doing at any point in time. In the case of the archer, the symbol will indicate that the archer is currently in a transporter. For workers the symbols indicate which resources they are harvesting, whether they are building or repairing something or are just standing around doing nothing."
"_ds_L00B55_Frame_0";"Sometimes you have a limited amount of time to complete certain assignments, in which case a countdown is displayed at the top of the screen. In this case you have to chase a fugitive. The best thing to do would be to use a chariot as it is faster than an infantry unit. If you have an archer on board you don't even have to catch up to the fugitive, as the archer can take him out from a distance. If you send out a number of different units with different speeds at the same time  the slowest unit determines the speed for all of them."
"_ds_L00B56_Frame_0";"Hurry! You don't have much time!"
"_ds_L00B57_Frame_0";"Traps are dangerous and remain hidden until someone sets them off or reveals them using a special ability. Once this has been done they can be attacked and destroyed."
